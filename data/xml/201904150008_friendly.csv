The 32-year-old woman from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu found her fears misplaced when she found none to block her at the Nilakkal base camp on the eve of the Vishu, the Malayalam New Year day.  This was not the case six months ago, when workers of right-wing outfits forced the women who between 10 and 50 years of age to return. The protesters had also taken position at other entry points and the entire hillock to ensure that no menstruating women entered the temple.  The protests following the 28 September Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all ages to enter the temple turned violent most when the temple was opened for the monthly puja and during the main pilgrim season. Hundreds of people, including police and media personnel, had come under attack from the self-styled guardians of the customs and traditions of the temple.  Kalavathi was afraid to visit Sabarimala as she had read reports about the violence. However, she was relieved when she did not find any protesters in the vicinity of Sabarimala when they arrived as Nilakkal. Police personnel posted at the base camp said that protesters belonging to all political hues had disappeared from the hill shrine following the announcement of the election.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey seem to have abandoned Ayyappa for the sake of votes. It is now clear that all the drama that Sabarimala witnessed after the Supreme Court passed the order was political,\xe2\x80\x9d said an officer who did not want to be identified.  Bharatiya Janata Party general secretary K Surendran, who was at the forefront of the protests, is now the BJP candidate in the Pathanamthitta Lok Sabha constituency. When asked why they have dropped the vigil at Sabarimala, he said they did not feel the need for the same as the Left Front government itself had abandoned their decision to take women of the forbidden age to Sabarimala.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe had entered the scene after Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan appeared adamant in implementing the apex court verdict. He has realised the folly of his decision and has refrained from taking young women to the hill shrine. Therefore, there is no need for us to guard the temple now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  Surendran said that the protests they organised had also created awareness among the devotees about the evil designs of the government. \xe2\x80\x9cThey themselves are coming forward to protect the customs and traditions of the temple without anybody prompting them,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.  However, Surendran and his party are not ready to leave Sabarimala in the election, despite a bar on invoking the names of Lord Ayyappa in the election by the Election Commission. Women\xe2\x80\x99s entry into the temple is the single largest issue of Surendran at Pathanamthitta, which is a Congress bastion. Without mentioning the name of the deity, Surendran has been seeking votes for Ayyappan.  \xe2\x80\x9cI know you have gathered here braving the scorching summer heat not because of your love for me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to tell you who has brought you here. Please vote for him and teach the Left a lesson,\xe2\x80\x9d Surendran told a moderate crowd of men and women who had gathered near Konni, 40 kms from Nilakkal, to greet him.  Before he reached the spot, the local leaders described him as a 'martyr'. They pointed out that 242 cases slapped by the Kerala police against him in connection with the Sabarimala issue was part of the government\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to silence those fighting for the rights of the faithful.  If the faithful consider the personal struggle waged by him in defending the customs and traditions of the Sabarimala temple genuine, K Surendran should win the election hands down. However, it is no cake walk for the BJP candidate.  Many of the faithful have started realising that the aggressive stand that Surendran and his party had taken against the LDF government\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to implement the apex court verdict was not borne out of genuine concern for faith but aimed at political capital.  The Nair Service Society (NSS), a community organisation of the upper caste Nairs that appreciated the support given by the Sangh Parivar in opposing the entry of young women in the temple, has chosen not to reciprocate the support in the political arena. The organisation that holds sway over the 14 percent Nair population in the district has decided to continue with its policy of maintaining equi-distance from both the Left and the Right.  Sabarimala Karma Samithi patron Swami Chidanandapuri\xe2\x80\x99s call to the Ayyappa devotees to vote for the Congress-led United Democratic Front\xe2\x80\x99s candidates in constituencies where the NDA is weak has also come as a setback to the BJP\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to use the issue to strengthen the party base in the state.  Though the opinion on social media was intended to ensure the defeat of the LDF, senior BJP leaders fear that the confusion it creates will affect the party\xe2\x80\x99s prospects in marginal seats.  BJP was counting on the support of NSS for the victory of Surendran at Pathanamthitta. Sources in the organisation said that the NSS leadership was not happy with the way Surendran, in particular, and the saffron party in general dragged the issue into the streets. NSS' official journal Service accused all political parties of trying to use Sabarimala for their electoral gains.  The NSS journal also doubts the sincerity of the BJP in finding a legal solution to the issue. In its editorial, Service said that the party had tried to prevent women on the streets instead of paying attention to the legal matters. The NSS leadership is also not impressed by the promise given by the BJP in its election manifesto to secure constitutional protection on issues related to faith and belief since it did nothing to fulfil its promise regarding the Ram temple at Ayodhya during its term. He said that the BJP cannot fool the people in Kerala with such empty words.  BJP can win the seat only if it is able to pool the votes of the entire majority community, which accounts for about 57 percent of the population in the district. None expects the entire Hindu votes to fall in the BJP kitty since a substantial chunk of them have been traditional supporters of UDF and LDF and it won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy for them to change political affiliations based on one issue.  \xe2\x80\x9cI know what the government has done at Sabarimala was not right. I am also hurt by the haste with which the government tried to implement the SC verdict. However, I cannot think of changing my political affiliation as I and my family have been supporting the Communist Party of India from my childhood. I will vote for the party candidate this time too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Govinga Pillai, a 75-year-old trader near Konni.  However, his wife Lalitha said she would not vote for the CPM this time. But she has not been able to decide whether to vote for BJP or Congress. She said many of her friends in the area were also confused like her. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will take a decision after seeing the campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lalitha.  Congress has been winning the seat ever since the constituency was carved out in 2009 with the support of a section of the Nair community and the minorities, who account for 43 percent of the population. However, party candidate Anto Antony\xe2\x80\x99s victory margin saw a drop from 1,11,206 votes in 2009 to 56,191 votes in 2014.  This was mainly due to an improved showing by the BJP, which increased its vote share from 7.08 percent to 15.98 percent votes during the period. A swing in minority votes in the 2016 Assembly election saw the LDF winning four Assembly segments.  However, the Congress camp expects that the moderate sections of the majority community will support the UDF, making Anto\xe2\x80\x99s victory easy. The LDF camp is pinning their hope on the progressive sections of the society. A tour across the constituency, comprising four Assembly segments in Pathanamthitta district and two in Kottayam district, show their number too short for a victory for Veena George, the LDF candidate.  The fight in Pathanamthitta is between BJP and the Congress. It is too early to predict who will have the last laugh in this extremely close fight.

On April 3, High Court Judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali set April 15 until May 10 to continue the trial of Najib, who is Pekan Member of Parliament.  The high profile trial would continue with counsel Harvinderjit Singh representing Najib to cross-examine the first witness, Muhammad Akmaludin Abdullah, 35, assistant registrar of Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM).  On the first day of trial, Muhammad Akmaludin told the court that SRC International Sdn Bhd, had a paid capital of RM1 million when it registered with the SSM on January 7, 2011, and checks on the shareholders also found that all one million shares were held by the Finance Ministry (Incorporated).  Najib, 66, is facing three counts of criminal breach of trust, one charge of abusing his position and three counts of money laundering over SRC International Sdn Bhd funds amounting to RM42 million.  He is alleged to have committed the offences at AmIslamic Bank Berhad in Jalan Raja Chulan and the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s Office in Putrajaya between August 17, 2011, and February 10, 2015.  Najib, who is the sixth prime minister of Malaysia, is the first to find himself in the accused dock.  Attorney-General Tommy Thomas in his opening statement on the first day of trial, among others, said the prosecution will prove that Najib had used his position as Prime Minister and Minister of Finance to obtain for himself a gratification of RM42 million.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my duty and privilege of opening the first trial in our courts against a former prime minister who, for nearly a decade, occupied the most powerful office in the land and wielded near absolute power.  \xe2\x80\x9cSuch privilege carries with it enormous responsibility, which my office intends to discharge in order to establish that the accused is guilty of the seven charges that he is facing before your lordship.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe accused during his entire period in office as Prime Minister of which time these offences were committed simultaneously held the office of Minister of Finance, thereby combining maximum political power and control of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s purse,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  Thomas also said \xe2\x80\x9cthe operation of Article 8 (1) of the Federal Constitution that \xe2\x80\x98all persons are equal before the law\xe2\x80\x99 is amply demonstrated by this trial\xe2\x80\x9d.  \xe2\x80\x9cA former Prime Minister is charged under due process in the ordinary court of the land, like any other accused. The accused is not above the law and his prosecution and this trial should serve as precedents for all future holders of this august office,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  Following are among others key ingredients in the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s opening statement read out by Thomas.  The prosecution will abundantly establish that the accused was directly involved in the decision on behalf of the Government of Malaysia to give government guarantees for the loans amounting to RM4 billion received by SRC International Sdn Bhd from Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) (\xe2\x80\x9cKWAP\xe2\x80\x9d).  The evidence will also establish that in December 2014, the accused\xe2\x80\x99s credit card was charged US$130,625 (RM537,456) for expenses made at Chanel, an exclusive fashion store in Honolulu.  The prosecution will prove that personal cheques were issued, among others, as payment for renovation works carried out at the accused\xe2\x80\x99s residence at Jalan Langgak Duta, Kuala Lumpur, the accused\xe2\x80\x99s residence in Pekan, Pahang as well as cheques were issued to various Barisan Nasional component political parties.  In proving the ingredients on the charge of abusing his position, evidence, both oral, documentary and circumstantial would be led by the prosecution to establish the proposed establishment of SRC International Sdn Bhd, the proposed setting-up of a RM3 billion grant, SRC International\xe2\x80\x99s request for a government loan for RM3.95 billion, appointments of SRC International\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Directors, and one Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil as CEO of SRC International.  The prosecution will also establish on matters that led to the approval of the Malaysian government, through the Ministry of Finance, the issuance of a RM2 billion government guarantee in favour of SRC International and for the issuance of a further RM2 billion government guarantee in favour of the company (SRC International).  The evidence will also be led regarding monies totalling RM42 million, sourced from SRC International, were channelled through the company accounts of Gandingan Mentari Sdn Bhd (a wholly-owned subsidiary of SRC International Sdn Bhd) and Ihsan Perdana Sdn Bhd (purportedly appointed as SRC International\xe2\x80\x99s corporate social responsibility partner).  For the criminal breach of trust (CBT) charges, the prosecution will establish that Najib, as Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and Advisor Emeritus of SRC International, whilst entrusted with monies belonging to SRC International, committed CBT in respect of the RM27 million, RM5 million and RM10 million belonging to SRC International.  The prosecution will also provide evidence that Najib had engaged in money laundering by receiving RM42 million, being the proceeds of unlawful activity, in his AmPrivate Banking account.  The evidence would also be led that Najib had issued 15 cheques from his bank account totalling RM10,776,514.00. \xe2\x80\x94 Bernama'",['OPEN-SOURCE INTERNET']

In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element.  Where to Find Gold in the United States?  Gold was discovered in Alabama about 1830, shortly following the Georgia Gold Rush. The principal districts were the Arbacoochee district in Cleburne County, mostly from placer deposits, and the Hog Mountain district in Tallapoosa County, which produced 24,000 troy ounces (750 kg) from veins in schist.  Russian explorers discovered placer gold in the Kenai River in 1848, but no gold was produced. Gold mining started in 1870 from placers southeast of Juneau. Alaska produced a total of 40,300,000 troy ounces (1,250,000 kg) of gold from 1880 through the end of 2007. In 2015 Alaskan mines produced 873,984 troy ounces (27,183.9 kg) of gold, 12.7% of US production. The largest gold producer is the Fort Knox mine, a large open pit and cyanide leaching operation in the Fairbanks mining district.  Arizona has produced more than 16 million troy ounces (498 tonnes) of gold.  Gold mining in Arizona reportedly began in 1774 when Spanish priest Manuel Lopez directed Papago Indians to wash gold from gravel on the flanks of the Quijotoa Mountains, Pima County. Gold mining continued there until 1849, when the Mexican miners were lured away by the California Gold Rush. Other gold mining under Spanish and Mexican rule took place in the Oro Blanco district of Santa Cruz County, and the Arivaca district, Pima County.  Mountain man Pauline Weaver discovered placer gold on the east side of the Colorado River in 1862. Weaver\xe2\x80\x99s discovery started the Colorado River Gold Rush to the now ghost town of La Paz, Arizona and other locations along the river in the ensuing years.  Spanish prospectors found gold in the Potholes district between 1775 and 1780, along the Colorado River, in present Imperial County, California, about ten miles northeast from Yuma, Arizona. The gold was recovered from dry placers. Other placer deposits on the west bank of the Colorado River were quickly found, including the Picacho and Cargo Muchacho districts.  Placer gold deposits were found at San Ysidro in San Diego County in 1828, San Francisquito Canyon and Placerita Canyon in Los Angeles County in 1835 and 1842, respectively  Major gold mining in California began during the California Gold Rush. Gold was found by James Marshall at Sutters Mill, property of John Sutter, in present-day Coloma. In 1849, people started hearing about the gold and after just a few years San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s population increased to thousands.  Gold was discovered in 1858 during the Pike\xe2\x80\x99s Peak Gold Rush in the vicinity of present-day Denver in 1858, but the deposits were small. The first important gold discoveries in Colorado were in the Central City-Idaho Springs district in January 1859. Only one Colorado mine continues to produce gold, the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine at Victor near Colorado Springs, an open-pit heap leach operation owned by Newmont Mining Corporation, which produced 360,000 troy ounces (11,000 kg) of gold in 2018.  Small amounts of gold were mined commercially in North Eastern Florida during the late 19th Century, at the site where Mike Roess Gold Head Branch State Park is located today. No records are extant on the amount of gold produced, but the find was insufficient to keep the operation running commercially, and the small amount of pay dirt was depleted within a matter of months.  Georgia is credited with a total historical production of 871,000 troy ounces (27,100 kg) of gold from 1830 through 1959. Although historically important, the state is not currently a gold producer.  Gold was first discovered in Idaho in 1860, in Pierce at the juncture where Canal Creek meets Orofino Creek.  The leading historical gold-producing district is the Boise Basin in Boise County, which was discovered in 1862 and produced 2.9 million troy ounces (90.2 tonnes), mostly from placers.  The French Creek-Florence district in Idaho County began in the 1860s, and has produced about 1 million troy ounces (31 tonnes) from placers.  The Silver City district in Owyhee County began producing in 1863, and made over 1 million troy ounces (31 tonnes), mostly from lode deposits.  The Coeur d\xe2\x80\x99Alene district in Shoshone County has made 44,000 troy ounces (1,400 kg) of gold as byproduct to silver mining.  In 2006, active gold mines in Idaho included the Silver Strand mine and the Bond mine.  Gold was reported in Maryland as early as 1830, but no production resulted. Placer gold was discovered at Great Falls near Washington, DC in 1861 during the American Civil War by Union soldiers from California. After the war a number of mines were opened on gold-bearing quartz veins in Montgomery County. No gold production has been reported since 1951. Total production was about 6,000 troy ounces (190 kg).  Approximately 29,000 troy ounces (900 kg) of gold were produced from the Ropes gold mine northeast of Ishpeming in Marquette County, Michigan. The underground mine, originally operated from 1880 to 1897, and reopened from 1983\xe2\x80\x931989, extracted gold from quartz veins in peridotite.  Gold was first discovered in Montana in 1852, but mining did not begin until 1862, when gold placers were discovered at Bannack, Montana in 1862. The resulting gold rush resulted in more placer discoveries, including those at Virginia City in 1863, and at Helena and Butte in 1864. In 1867, the Atlantic Cable Quartz Lode was located.  The Butte district, although mined primarily for copper, produced 2.9 million ounces (91 tones) of gold through 1990, almost all as a byproduct of copper production.  Current active hardrock gold mines include the Montana Tunnels mine, and the Golden Sunlight mine. Active gold placers include the Browns Gulch placer and the Confederate Gulch placer. Gold is also produced from three platinum mines in the Stillwater igneous complex: the Stillwater mine, the Lodestar mine, and the East Boulder Project.  Nevada is the leading gold-producing state in the nation, in 2016 producing 5,467,646 troy ounces (170.06 tonnes), representing 81% of US gold and 5.5% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s production. Much of the gold in Nevada comes from large open pit mining and with heap leaching recovery. Some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s major mining companies, including Newmont Mining, Barrick Gold and Kinross Gold, operate gold mines in the state. Active major mines include Cortez, Twin Creeks, Betz-Post, Meikle, Marigold, Round Mountain, Jerritt Canyon and Getchell.  Newmont and Barrick operate the largest mining operations, on the prolific Carlin Trend, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest mining districts.  Gold was first discovered in New Mexico in 1828 in the \xe2\x80\x9cOld Placers\xe2\x80\x9d district in the Ortiz Mountains, Santa Fe County, New Mexico. The placer gold discovery was followed by discovery of a nearby lode deposit.  In 1877, two prospectors collected float in the area of the future Opportunity Mine near Hillsboro, New Mexico, which was assayed at $160 per ton in gold and silver. Soon, ore was discovered at the nearby Rattlesnake vein and a placer deposit of gold was found in November at the Rattlesnake and Wicks gulches. Total production prior to 1904 was about $6,750,000.  In 2007 all gold production in New Mexico (13,000 troy ounces (400 kg)) came as a byproduct of copper mining from two large open pit mines in Grant County. However, two primary gold mines are being readied for production: the Northstar mine in Rio Arriba County, and the San Lorenzo Claims mine in Socorro County.  North Carolina was the site of the first gold rush in the United States, following the discovery of a 17-pound (7.7 kg) gold nugget by 12-year-old Conrad Reed in a creek at his father\xe2\x80\x99s farm in 1799. The Reed Gold Mine, southwest of Georgeville in Cabarrus County, North Carolina produced about 50,000 troy ounces (1,600 kg) of gold from lode and placer deposits.  Gold was produced from 15 districts, almost all in the Piedmont region of the state. Total gold production is estimated at 1.2 million troy ounces (37.3 tonnes).  Although gold mines are spread over much of Oregon, almost all of the gold produced has come from two principal areas: the Klamath Mountains in southwest Oregon, including Coos, Curry, Douglas, Jackson and Josephine counties; and the Blue Mountains in northeast Oregon, mostly in Baker and Grant counties.  Prospectors from Illinois discovered placer gold in the Klamath Mountains of southwest Oregon in 1850, starting a rush to the area. Lode gold deposits were also discovered.  Travellers along the Oregon Trail bound for the Willamette Valley are said to have discovered gold in northeastern Oregon in 1845, but mining in earnest did not begin until 1861.  About 37,000 troy ounces (1,200 kg) of gold was produced from the Cornwall iron mine five miles south of Lebanon, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. Although the deposit produced iron since 1742, no gold was reported from the mine until 1878.  South Carolina had a number of lode gold mines along the Carolina Slate Belt.[38]  The Haile deposit was discovered in Lancaster County in 1827, and at least 257,000 troy ounces (8,000 kg) of gold were extracted intermittently between then and 1942, when the gold mine was ordered closed as nonessential to the war effort. Beginning in 1951, the deposit was mined for associated sericite, which was used as a white filler.  The only operating gold mine in South Dakota is the Wharf mine, at Lead, an open pit heap leach operation operated by Coeur Mining that produced 109,000 ounces of gold in 2016.  Placer gold was discovered on Coker Creek in Monroe County, Tennessee in 1827. The district produced about 9,000 troy ounces (280 kg).  About 15,000 troy ounces (470 kg) of gold was recovered from the massive sulfide copper ores at Ducktown, Tennessee.  Some prospects have been excavated for gold on the Llano Uplift of central Texas. Gold prospects include the Heath mine and the Babyhead district, both in Llano County, and the Central Texas mine in Gillespie County. Gold production, if any, is not known. Historically, the Lost Nigger Gold Mine may be in Texas.  Most gold produced in Utah today is a byproduct of the huge Bingham Canyon copper mine, southwest of Salt Lake City. In 2013, the Bingham Canyon mine produced 192,300 troy ounces (5,980 kg) of gold. Over its life, Bingham Canyon has produced more than 23 million ounces (715 tonnes) of gold, making it one of the largest gold producers in the US.  The Barneys Canyon mine in Salt Lake County, the last primary gold mine to operate in Utah, stopped mining in 2001, but is still recovering gold from its heap leaching pads. Utah gold production was 460,000 troy ounces (14,000 kg) in 2006.  Most gold mining in Virginia was concentrated in the Virginia Gold-Pyrite belt in a line that runs northeast to southwest through the counties of Fairfax, Prince William, Stafford, Fauquier, Culpeper, Spotsylvania, Orange, Louisa, Fluvanna, Goochland, Cumberland, and Buckingham. Some gold was also mined in Halifax, Floyd, and Patrick counties.  Gold was first discovered in Washington in 1853, as placer deposits in the Yakima Valley. Production from the state never exceeded 50,000 troy ounces per year until the mid-1930s, when large hard rock deposits were developed near the Chelan Lake and Wenatchee deposits in Chelan County, and the Republic deposit in Ferry County. Production through 1965 is estimated to be 2.3 million ounces.  Gold was discovered at the South Pass-Atlantic City-Sweetwater district in present Fremont County in 1842. The placers were worked intermittently until 1867, when the first important gold vein was discovered, and prospectors and miners rushed to the area.. The towns of South Pass City, Atlantic City, and Miner\xe2\x80\x99s Delight catered to the miners. The district was nearly deserted by 1875, and was worked only intermittently afterward. Total gold production was about 300,000 troy ounces (9,300 kg). In 1962, the district became the site of a major iron mine.  The first significant gold rush in the United States was in Cabarrus County, North Carolina (east of Charlotte), in 1799 at today\xe2\x80\x99s Reed\xe2\x80\x99s Gold Mine. Thirty years later, in 1829, the Georgia Gold Rush in the southern Appalachians occurred. It was followed by the California Gold Rush of 1848\xe2\x80\x9355 in the Sierra Nevada, which captured the popular imagination.  The California gold rush led directly to the settlement of California by Americans and the rapid entry of that state into the union in 1850. The gold rush in 1849 stimulated worldwide interest in prospecting for gold, and led to new rushes in Australia, South Africa, Wales and Scotland.  Successive gold rushes occurred in western North America: Fraser Canyon, the Cariboo district and other parts of British Columbia, in Nevada, in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, eastern Oregon, and western New Mexico Territory and along the lower Colorado River. Resurrection Creek, near Hope, Alaska was the site of Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s first gold rush in the mid\xe2\x80\x931890s. Other notable Alaska Gold Rushes were Nome, Fairbanks, and the Fortymile River.  One of the last \xe2\x80\x9cgreat gold rushes\xe2\x80\x9d was the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Yukon Territory (1896\xe2\x80\x9399). This gold rush is immortalised in the novels of Jack London, and Charlie Chaplin\xe2\x80\x99s film The Gold Rush. Robert William Service depicted with talent in his poetries the dramatic event of the Gold Rush, especially in the book The Trail of \xe2\x80\x9998. The main goldfield was along the south flank of the Klondike River near its confluence with the Yukon River near what was to become Dawson City in Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Yukon Territory, but it also helped open up the relatively new US possession of Alaska to exploration and settlement, and promoted the discovery of other gold finds.'",['OPEN-SOURCE INTERNET']

The wife had reported her to police for two social media messages posted on Facebook in 2016. She was finally reunited with her 14-year-old daughter Paris in the arrivals hall at Heathrow on Friday, following an international outcry over her treatment. Laleh, 55, from Richmond, Surrey, wept as she admitted: ""The day before I was told I was free to go I\'d given up hope and was suicidal. ""I felt like I was never going to see my daughter again and sent a message to my sister saying \'I can\'t do this anymore\'. I told her \'It\'s killing me, every day is killing me. I felt so much pain and then I turned off my phone. I could see my whole life flashing before my eyes and I just wanted to die. It was torture to me.""  Laleh, a privately educated doctor\'s daughter, was arrested at Dubai International Airport on March 10 after she and Paris travelled to the emirate so they could grieve at the graveside of Laleh\'s ex-husband Pedro Correia Dos Santos after he died of a heart attack aged 51, seven days earlier. At passport control Laleh was hauled away by police, who told her that her ex\'s new wife had made a legal complaint about two Facebook posts, including one where she had been described as ""a horse"". Laleh said: ""I couldn\'t understand what was happening and then a police officer came in and said \'There\'s a complaint against you - do you know Samah al Hammadi?\' ""I just burst into tears. I had been arrested for two Facebook posts made in the UK three years ago. ""I still had no idea about what was going to unfold and the full extent of the trouble I was in. I just thought \'This will all be fine and over by tomorrow\'.""  Laleh spent 12 hours at a police station where she was ordered to sign a statement, despite it being in Arabic and her having no understanding of what it said. She later discovered the translation of the Facebook post bore no relation to what she had written, with a swear word substituted for the word ""horse"". The posts, which Laleh wrote after seeing a photo of her ex-husband getting married to his new Tunisian lover Samah al Hammadi, 42, said: ""I hope you go under the ground you idiot. Damn you. You left me for this horse"" and ""You married a horse you idiot"". She said: ""I know I shouldn\'t have posted the messages, but at the time I was distraught. ""It had never occurred to me and took me completely by surprise. I was being arrested for calling her a horse, I thought \'this is nonsense\'.""  Laleh, who was educated at Tormead School in Guildford, Surrey, and used to work for London auctioneers Bonhams, was told she was being held in Dubai while she awaited a court hearing. It was at that point she made the heartbreaking decision to send Paris home on her own. Laleh said: ""Paris was absolutely terrified. I thought \'I can\'t subject her to one more minute of this\'. ""I\'m still getting shakes now thinking about that moment because I think that was when I realised everything had become real. ""It was the single hardest thing I\'ve ever had to do. ""Her father had died less than two weeks earlier and now she was losing her mother. I felt like I was failing her as a parent, but I knew I had no power over the situation.""  On Thursday, after Paris wrote a touching letter to Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai and prime minister of the UAE, Laleh finally appeared before the Dubai Court of Misdemeanours. Judge Mohamed Mustafa Ibrahim Khalil said she could be released from the country if she paid a \xc2\xa3624 fine. She said: ""It felt like I was dreaming and I didn\'t believe it was real. ""I burst into tears of happiness and disbelief when I got my passport, but I didn\'t allow myself to believe it was all really all over until I got on the plane. I just felt numb."" After being put on a flight from Dubai in the early hours of Friday morning she was finally reunited with Paris at Heathrow. Laleh said: ""The moment I saw Paris at the airport was such an overwhelming moment. My heart was aching for her and being able to hold my girl again was so emotional.  ""I\'ll never forget that moment. Being apart from her had been brutal. ""I still feel like I\'m in a daze and I feel like a fraction of the person I was before. ""This last month has completely broken me physically and mentally, it has traumatised me. ""I just want to enjoy life with Paris now and cherish every moment.""'",['OPEN-SOURCE INTERNET']

The serial predator and suspected killer is believed to be responsible for raping and kidnapping at least a dozen young girls across the city in the late 1980s and early 90s - and to this day has never been caught or identified.  Two girls kidnapped by Mr Cruel - Sharon Wills, ten, and Nicola Lynas, 13 - were eventually released, but 13-year-old Karmein Chan's remains were found a year after her abduction. She had been shot three times in the head.  Australian Crime Stories revisited the Melbourne schoolgirl's case on the 28th anniversary of her abduction and murder on Sunday night.  Karmein's case stood out from all the others because she was the only victim to be killed by the rapist after she was taken.  Karmein's case stood out from all the others because she was the only victim to be killed by the rapist after she was taken.

Mr Cruel attacked girls as young as 11 in \xc2\xadMelbourne in the 1980s and 1990s. The paedophile has never been identified. August 22, 1987, Lower Plenty: He broke into house in the night, locked the parents in a wardrobe and attacked their 11-year-old daughter December 27, 1988, Ringwood: He broke into a house, tied up the parents and abducted their 10-year-old daughter, releasing her at a school 18 hours later July 3, 1990, Canterbury: He broke into house and abducted a 13-year-old. He drove her to another house where he kept her for 50 hours before release. April 13, 1991 Templestowe: He broke into a house and abducted Karmein Chan, 13. Her body was found a year later.  'It doesn't make any sense. Good criminals, offenders, serial offenders, they don't get scared off. They believe, their ego believes they're better than the system, they're better than investigators,' Dr Stephen Barron, psychologist and former police inspector said.  Although Mr Cruel had been perceived as a dark, mysterious figure in the public eye, investigators suggested the serial rapist could actually just be 'Mr Average.'  Following Karmein's abduction, Australian authorities had sought help from the American FBI - who revealed there was nothing particularly striking about Mr Cruel's profile.  He was believed to be between 20 and 50 years old, between 165 and 183cm tall, thin to medium build with a potbelly.  He also did not have a distinct accent and was described as quietly spoken.  Mr Cruel's weapon of choice was a knife and he was known to wear a balaclava and had taped over his victims' eyes to shield his identity.  Other theories suggest Karmein had been bold enough to rip off the tape from her eyes or had pulled Mr Cruel's mask off, revealing his identity and forcing him to kill her.  But some investigators say it is unlikely a serial offender would be 'scared off' and believe it is possible Mr Cruel went quiet because he left town to continue his attacks overseas or elsewhere.  'My suspicion is that he probably just left town or he went to jail and died,' Criminal psychologist Tim Watson Munro said.  'There were the Hillside Stranglers in Los Angeles. A guy and his cousin were abducting, raping and murdering women in the Hills district of LA, dumping the cadavers on the front lawns of places as all part of the horror show, and it stopped as abruptly as it started.  'He was eventually discovered in Oregon, so, he'd relocated, he'd gone further north, into a different state. It started again.'  Although nearly three decades have passed since Mr Cruel's last attack, retired Detective Chris O'Connor said the investigation remains active.""",['OPEN-SOURCE INTERNET']

The problem of China hacking US businesses and stealing intellectual property has been going on for decades. But when it comes to fighting the crime wave from China, the US government has been hampered by a lack of cooperation from the victims.  In dozens of interviews with U.S. government and business representatives, officials involved in commerce with China said hacking and theft were an open secret for almost two decades, allowed to quietly continue because U.S. companies had too much money at stake to make waves. Wendy Cutler, who was a veteran negotiator at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, says it wasn\'t just that U.S. businesses were hesitant to come forward in specific cases. She says businesses didn\'t want the trade office to take ""any strong action."" ""We are not as effective if we don\'t have the U.S. business community supporting us,"" she says. ""Looking back on it, in retrospect, I think we probably should have been more active and more responsive. We kind of lost the big picture of what was really happening."" None of the dozens of companies or organizations that NPR reached out to that have been victims of theft or corporate espionage originating from China would go on the record. And for its part, the Chinese government officially denied to NPR and Frontline that it has been involved in such practices.  It\'s estimated that Chinese unfair business practices are costing American companies $57 billion a year. But the exposure of company secrets can mean an incalcuable loss.  But now the impact of that secrecy is coming to light, they say. Companies are facing hundreds of millions of dollars in future losses from the theft, and U.S. officials say they are years behind trying to tackle the problem. Michael Wessel, commissioner on the U.S. government\'s U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, says it wasn\'t supposed to be this way. U.S. officials had high hopes when China officially joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. ""There was a honeymoon period in the first six or seven years, a desire to try [to] make things work,"" Wessel says. But, he says, starting around 2006, businesses began coming to him saying that China had stolen their designs or ideas or had pressured them into partnerships and taken their technology. Just like with Hickton, Wessel says, they wouldn\'t come forward publicly.  China is counting on this code of omerta by American businesses as they continue with business as usual. But you would think that eventually, China\'s stealing will become so prevelant, that US companies will be forced to cooperate for self preservation.'",['OPEN-SOURCE INTERNET']

Geographically, it sits in the middle of the country. Of the 50 states in the union, it was chronologically the 21st to enter. By land area, it is the 25th largest state, connecting the Great Lakes on its east to the Mississippi River on its west. Its population and economy have much in common with the rest of the country.      Like many states, Illinois must strike a balance between its urban core, Chicago, which contains the majority of its population; and the rural expanse that represents the majority of its space and natural resources. Its capital, Springfield, sits in the middle of the state, a three-hour drive from Chicago, assuming no traffic. The concerns of urban residents, like gang violence and public transit, are unfamiliar to those in the rest of the state. These differences in location and lifestyle are much like the gaps between New York City and Albany; Los Angeles and Sacramento; Miami and Tallahassee.      Illinois is also emblematic of the dire fiscal state of U.S. states. While Illinois faces a uniquely difficult challenge, it offers lessons to others seeking to avoid bad outcomes.        As we discussed last year, decades of neglect in funding pensions for state workers drove Illinois\xe2\x80\x99 finances to the brink of a junk credit rating, while a political standoff nearly brought the state to insolvency. Illinois has also borne the downside risks of trade conflicts. Illinois\xe2\x80\x99 farmers have made it the leading producer of soybeans among U.S. states, while its already-struggling manufacturers had to absorb higher steel and aluminum prices.      Since our last writing, a new governor has taken office. The expensive campaign between two self-funded businessmen has been a recurring theme in many gubernatorial races. Also common across the country has been the \xe2\x80\x9coutsiders\xe2\x80\x9d promising to lead with a business perspective instead of the entrenched views of career politicians.      The new governor, J. B. Pritzker, recognizes the need for drastic fiscal action. Illinois\xe2\x80\x99s constitution uniquely forbids a graduated income tax and contains strict protection for public workers\xe2\x80\x99 pensions. The state\xe2\x80\x99s current flat income tax and sales tax put a regressively higher tax burden on lower earners. Amending the constitution is on Pritzker\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, but an amendment cannot be brought for a vote until November 2020 and will not be in place until 2021 at earliest.      Even if the constitutional restriction is lifted, the future tax outlook is uncertain. Pritzker has proposed a graduated income tax plan, notable for its millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s tax: Taxpayers earning over $1,000,000 would lose their marginal tax increases and instead see all income taxed at the highest rate. The proposal is imperfect and not binding, but it gives a clear signal of where taxes are going.      The risks and costs of tax increases have grown in light of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). One of TCJA\xe2\x80\x99s most substantial changes was its limitation of $10,000 state and local tax (SALT) deductions against federal income tax. Before this cap, residents of higher-tax states could find some consolation in reducing their federal tax burden with their substantial state income and property taxes. With the SALT cap, every local tax increase carries a higher real cost to taxpayers.      Competition among states cannot be ignored. While economic development incentives can be a race to the bottom, the higher a state\xe2\x80\x99s tax rates rise, the more tempting it is for businesses and residents to relocate. Illinois has been losing population for five years running.            Pritzker has made more immediate proposals to raise additional state revenue without income tax changes. If all proposals are implemented, they could raise over $1.1 billion in additional annual revenue for the state, a good start but not sufficient to close its structural deficit of $3.2 billion.      With so many categories of taxes and fees, comparing tax burdens between states is nuanced. No state has zero taxes, and those with low or no taxes in one category (like Texas\xe2\x80\x99 lack of an income tax) make up for it with others (like the Lone Star state\xe2\x80\x99s high property taxes). Today, Illinois\xe2\x80\x99 combined tax burden leaves it some headroom to increase taxes, but not by much.      The pension funding gap started with a decision in the mid-1990s to defer a small portion of pension payments. Unfortunately for today\xe2\x80\x99s Illinois taxpayers, the deferral was an effective tool to balance the budget. Subsequent governors routinely underfunded the pension or paid by issuing bonds. The state took 25 years to reach its current straits, and it will take a similar duration of fiscal restraint to recover from it. Even Pritzker\xe2\x80\x99s own budget proposal, full of tax and fee increases, envisions the pension program reaching a funded ratio of only 65% by the year 2045.      A slow slog is the only realistic approach. Bankruptcy is not an option, as the federal bankruptcy code does not allow states to undergo reorganization. Any attempt to seek a bailout from the federal government would face strident objections from the other 49 states that exercised fiscal discipline, setting up a prolonged fight with an uncertain outcome.      Illinois\xe2\x80\x99 pain is not for naught if other states learn from this episode. Most states offer generous pension plans, and fixed income investors are happy to purchase state bonds. The temptation to underfund a pension will always be present, but it is folly. As recently as 2010, Illinois was just one of several high-risk states, with analysts equally worried about the fiscal conditions of California, New Jersey and Ohio. These other risky states took their medicine to correct their fiscal gaps: New Jersey raised its property taxes to the highest rates in the nation; California boosted its income and sales taxes. Ohio has provided an encouraging example of a recovery without a tax increase, as disciplined spending amid an economic recovery helped to balance its budget.      Illinois has a long history of change. The natives in Cahokia, and Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo, moved on from their settlements; Chicago rebuilt from a devastating fire. Today, the most successful regions in the U.S. are those that have planned well and adapted quickly to meet today\xe2\x80\x99s economic needs. The sooner and more decisively Illinois leaders act to correct the state\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings, the better the future will be for those of us who live here.      Frenemies      Last October, Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\xc5\x8d Abe arrived in Beijing for the first bilateral trip by a Japanese leader to China in seven years. The visit was nominally intended to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship. More broadly, however, the diplomatic d\xc3\xa9tente, initiated in 2017 after years of enduring rivalry, can be attributed to the countries\xe2\x80\x99 common interest in standing up to U.S. trade restrictions.      Despite some unfortunate history and important strategic differences, trade between the two Asian rivals has flourished. For Japanese companies, China is not only the world\xe2\x80\x99s factory but is also a key consumer of their products. China has emerged as the top destination for Japanese products: its share of total Japanese exports has increased significantly from just 5% in 1998 to 20% in 2018. Over the same time period, the U.S. share of exports from Japan has declined from 31% to 19%.      Though Japan has managed to diversify its export markets, it relies heavily on the United States for its defense. Japan\xe2\x80\x99s political and economic systems are similar to those in the U.S., and Japan shares the American goal of curbing China\xe2\x80\x99s growing influence in the Asia-Pacific region (including in the South China Sea). In addition, Japan and China have rival development banks aimed at helping emerging Asian nations.      Japan\xe2\x80\x99s increased reliance on Chinese demand has led to concerns over whether the weakening Chinese economy will bring Japan down with it. Exports to China have also decreased notably on the back of the slowing Chinese economy. Elevated trade uncertainty has been weighing on Japanese exports.      Japan\xe2\x80\x99s increasing dependence on Chinese demand is visible across several industries as the structure of exports has evolved considerably since the early 2000s. At one point, Japan\xe2\x80\x99s exports were only assembled in China before being re-exported to Japan and other economies. Thus, Chinese demand had only a limited impact on Japanese exports.      In last few years, however, Japanese goods have been directly catering to China\xe2\x80\x99s domestic demand. Sales of Japanese final products to China have increased significantly since the early 2000s from around 34% to 74% of total sales. The Chinese middle class has grown, and grown wealthier, stimulating demand for Japanese products.            Weaker Chinese demand isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only concern for Japanese exporters. China has transitioned itself from manufacturing textiles and toys to production of high-tech components, machinery and electronics. The percentage of value-added products made domestically for exports touched 87% in China compared to Japan at 79% in 2018. Chinese companies are now more direct competitors for Japanese firms.      Beyond trade, China is also an important source of overseas investment and tourism to Japan. But owing to China\xe2\x80\x99s protective regime, Japan\xe2\x80\x99s direct investment to China has grown sluggishly. China accounts for only 5.7% of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s total outward foreign direct investment. By contrast, Japan has made a considerable amount of direct investment (around $470 billion) in the U.S., particularly in the wholesale trade and manufacturing sectors.      For Japan, balancing the economic and strategic aspects of its relationship with China is difficult. The task will become even harder if the wedge between Washington and Beijing widens further. But for now, the Japanese seem to have kept the two realms from interfering with one another. Their experience might be a useful lesson for others.      No Place for Partisans      Since its establishment more than 100 years ago, the Federal Reserve Board has included governors with a broad range of backgrounds, political views and life experiences. Some have been loud, others quiet; some are academics, while others come from industry. Organizations that invite a diversity of thought typically make better choices than those with more homogeneous constitutions.      While many Fed decisions are unanimous, debate within the walls is active and dissents do occur. Those who suggest the Board is mired in groupthink should have a closer look at the minutes, meeting transcripts and forecast dispersion. But while participants have their differences, the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s culture is consensus-driven and apolitical. This character allows it to take a long view and lean against markets and fiscal strategy when necessary.      The proposed nominations of Stephen Moore and Herman Cain to the board of governors threaten to compromise the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s strong character. Both have been major fundraisers for the president, and both have pledged to use their posts on the Board to support the White House program. They seem intent on bringing a political agenda into a forum that tries to operate without one.            The proposed selections of Moore and Cain come on the back of the president\xe2\x80\x99s recent criticism of Jay Powell, the Fed chairman. In the most recent salvo, the president apparently told Powell, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess I\xe2\x80\x99m stuck with you.\xe2\x80\x9d      This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time a world leader has pressed for easier money to accommodate fiscal imbalances or boost political fortunes. But such campaigns create long-term problems that ultimately prove harmful.      The Fed is not infallible, and observers have frequently disagreed with its decisions. But those decisions are taken with the long-term interests of the economy in mind, and made on the basis of the best available information. The desire to favor one party or another doesn\xe2\x80\x99t enter into the discussion.      There is no guarantee that Moore and Cain will ultimately be seated on the Fed. And if they are, two votes do not a consensus make. But for those who admire the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s mission and morals, now is the time to speak up. .'",['OPEN-SOURCE INTERNET']

Recent tests showed facial recognition systems made by companies like I.B.M. and Amazon were less accurate at identifying the features of darker-skinned people.  China\xe2\x80\x99s efforts raise starker issues. While facial recognition technology uses aspects like skin tone and face shapes to sort images in photos or videos, it must be told by humans to categorize people based on social definitions of race or ethnicity. Chinese police, with the help of the start-ups, have done that.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something that seems shocking coming from the U.S., where there is most likely racism built into our algorithmic decision making, but not in an overt way like this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jennifer Lynch, surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not a system designed to identify someone as African-American, for example.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Chinese A.I. companies behind the software include Yitu, Megvii, SenseTime, and CloudWalk, which are each valued at more than $1 billion.

The companies\xe2\x80\x99 valuations soared in 2018 as China\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Public Security, its top police agency, set aside billions of dollars under two government plans, called Skynet and Sharp Eyes, to computerize surveillance, policing and intelligence collection.

The issue of derogatory journalism came on the surface immediately when the US Federal Court in New York made its ruling on 8th March 2019, the media all over the world went awash with this decision as a breaking news item. Most notable, were the big-time Media houses from the Western world, they chose to the item but in the language so demeaning, derogating and full of innuendos against the parties on the side of Africa, the parties that were using the court to enforce the justifiable rights of the families of the people of Namibia that historically suffered the massacres, mass killing, forced displacement and brutal violence perpetrated by the Germany colonial adventurists.  After getting repulsed with how the New York Times had maintained a sarcastic timbre in the many in which it reported this matter, I chose to sample, Deutsch Welle, Washington Post, the Reuters and the Daily Mail to find out how they had reported the matter, it was all disgusting, it all read like the sentences from the passages of racism in Conrad\xe2\x80\x99s Heart of Darkness.  The Deutsche Welle was the leading in this kind of derogatory Journalism; it uses the word \xe2\x80\x98tribe\xe2\x80\x99 where it was supposed to use the word Nation of Namibia, it used the word \xe2\x80\x98tribal plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99 where it was supposed to use the word \xe2\x80\x98plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99, It uses the word \xe2\x80\x98tribal lawyer\xe2\x80\x99 when it was supposed to be the \xe2\x80\x98prosecuting lawyer\xe2\x80\x99. The Deutsche Welle also uses article \xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99 in referring to the plaintiff side when it was supposed to be article \xe2\x80\x98the\xe2\x80\x99. I Mean it was a pageant of sarcastic journalism with very funny photos of emaciated and lugubrious black children in a company of miserable black women inserted in different parts of the body of the story. The story and the pictures are available online, my dear reader, you can visit the websites and confirm for yourself. The Western media must desist from such type of self-defeating journalism for the sake of respecting the dignity of global audience.  In regard to the matter, the local media quoted the German legal representative and negotiator with Namibia government, Ruprecht Polenz, to be insensitively commenting that failure of the case was predictable, given that the case was more of political and moral issue, but not a legal issue. This is only four years since the government of Germany refused to make official apology to the people of Namibia. Thus, it can as well be inferred that the New York federal judge Laura Taylor Swain dismissed this case without necessarily considering the evidence and the philosophy of Natural justice, but by only listening to Western politics of self-justification about Africa, which is usually influenced by racial consciousness but not objective consideration of facts.  The indubitable facts are that after 1860 every country in Europe had a ministry in charge of colonies. Germany as one of the major players in European imperialism had a well-established ministry in charge of colonial resources. In the early 1900s, Germany government through its ministry of colonial affairs ordered it overseas troops in Africa to kill those protesting its colonial entry into Namibia. It was General Lothar von Trotha that issued the order. The order was executed. Over one million un-armed people of Namibia were killed. Most of them were un-armed women and children. Research into this history by Assa Okoth, published as a high school text book of African History, reveals that the massacre affected all the communities of Namibia, however the Herero and Namaqua were the most affected.  After this massacre, the Germany colonial troops looted and plundered resources as well as effecting mass seizure of properties. The troops also took the skulls of their victims to Germany for sale to the government hospital as materials resources for medical research. The people of Germany have been so un-ashamed of such sale of the skulls to an extent that as recent as 2015 some bones and the skulls were evidently sold by the wife of a certain German anthropologist to the American Museum of Natural History.  It is somewhat unspeakable to learn that it is not only Germany that has refused to be Accountable and apologetic for the brutalities committed to Africa. Many other countries took advantages of Africa\xe2\x80\x99s un-developed state of arms technology to brutalize the people of Africa. Joe Khamis in his latest book, the Wretched Africans (2019) reports that the countries of the middle East and Britain colluded to falsify data or statistics about the number of black people raided as slaves from Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia in last three centuries to be sold across the Indian ocean to Bombay and then other parts of the Arab world. So far there is no any country in the Arab world that has information about what happened to the lives of black slaves that were taken to their countries.  Joe Khamis in the same Wretched Africans reports that over 10 million black slaves were taken across the Indian ocean to Bombay (India) for resale to Europe and Arab countries. But as today there is no any surviving black family with the black-slave ancestry anywhere in the Arab world. The slaves that were not sold to Europe or Arab world were dumped in Bombay, then they were used by Indian merchants as domestic slaves, on the eventuality of worldwide abolition of slavery, the Indian community drove the black ex-slaves into the forest, until now these ex-slave black people live in the Bombay wild forest with animals as if they part of the wild nature, they are usually referred to sarcastically as the Bombay black men.  The media in India managed to keep this violated black community in the bush of darkness, it kept in secret for over a century, no one ever knew that there are black people living in the wild bush in India with no education, domestic homes and access to government services. It was until four years ago that the media in Kenya made some efforts to run a feature story about the Bombay Black families living in the Wild forest .it was taunting. Unfortunately, India and the Arab world have never apologized to Africa.  There are some other massacres committed by the British on the people of Kenya but history and the conventional opportunism in the bourgeoisie media chose to remain oblivious about them. Some of these massacres are the West Pokot Massacre committed in the year 1947 during which over five thousand peasant followers of Elijah Masinde\xe2\x80\x99s Dini ya Msambwa were killed. Another infamous savage killing of Africans by the British but also held in oblivion is the Bukusu Massacre perpetrated by Charlese Hobley, Gunter Wagner and William Grant in 1904 in which over 10 thousand people were killed in Bungoma and Webuye.  When you venture to read A Good Muslim, a Bad Muslim, by Mahmood Mamdan, there are facts and evidences of modern massacres perpetrated as late as 1990\xe2\x80\x99s through the terrorist-like American wars of proxies in Angola and Mozambique. But American politics of self-righteousness has never accepted to call them massacres, instead they were verbally ornamented by the American press as Low Intensity Conflicts (LIC), for no another reason but for selfish social-justification otherwise known as impunity. An impunity of military kind in such a juncture.  In a word, Europe and America are not willing to remember how they brutalized Africa. Europe is not ready to remember how it used black soldiers in the first and second world wars, without giving any decent burial to those that died in battle-field nor compensating or re-settling those that fought the wars to the end. America is not ready to remember how the sweat, blood and labour of black slaves was mercilessly consumed up in producing American economic greatness, only to leave the black American families to wallow in persistent poverty until now. Neither of them, America and Europe have apologized to Africa. Such a history of un-punished violation of the rights of a black person is the only force that made the Federal judge to gambol in decision with the Namibian case against Germany, but not facts of evidence. It is a judicial bungle of the century.'",['OPEN-SOURCE INTERNET']

Share the link of this article with your facebook friends While brutal force has been used to create Zionist Israel and sustain it thus far, Zionist claims to Palestine are false. Actually, from the five thousand years of known written history, there has been a continuous Palestinian-Canaanite presence in the Holy Land. Despite the Zionist false claims, the ancient Israelites ruled part of the land for only 85 years (during the reign of David, Solomon, and Solomon's son). After that, the Egyptians conquered Palestine-Canaan in 925 BC, followed by Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, before the Arab Muslim rule, starting from 636 AD. By the Time Jesus started his mission, the three population groups of Canaanites, Palestinians, and Israelites were melted together in religion and language. Most of them became Christians when Constantine converted in 313 AD. Then, most of them became Muslims in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. So, Palestinian Muslims, Christians, and Jews are the ones who have the right to claim descent from ancient Israelites, Palestinians, and Canaanites, not Zionists from other continents. The following news stories are just examples of the Israeli occupation government violations of Palestinian human rights, on daily basis. http://imemc.org/, https://paltoday.ps/ar/ More detailed news stories can be found at the following sources: https://english.palinfo.com/ Maisara Abu Shallouf, 15, was killed inside Gaza Strip by Israeli occupation soldiers from across the border, April 12, 2019 Palestinian Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face,   by Israeli occupation soldiers, in Hebron, April 14, 2019 Palestinian school children attacked by tear gas by Israeli occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 14, 2019 Palestinian protesters attacked by tear gas by Israeli   occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 12, 2019 A Palestinian man Saturday was shot in the face by Israeli occupation forces for unknown reasons, north of the city of Hebron in the southern West Bank, according to Maan News. Witnesses said that the victim, Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face, by Israeli police forces. The bullet was reported to have traveled completely through the young man\xe2\x80\x99s face, as seen in the above photo. Medical sources described the injury as moderate, and said Abu Fanous was transferred to a local medical center for treatment. Nowhere is Israel\xe2\x80\x99s use of excessive force against the civilian Palestinian population more clearly exhibited than in the Gaza Strip. Since March 2018, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, 203 Palestinians have been killed, and 12, 056 have been wounded, among those include women, children, medical personnel, and journalists. Israeli occupation soldiers attacked, on Friday evening, the weekly Great March Processions in the besieged Gaza Strip, killing one child, and injuring at 55 others, including one who suffered serious wounds, and two medics. The Palestinian Health Ministry has reported that the soldiers shot a child, identified as Maisara Mousa Ali Abu Shallouf, 15, after shooting him with live fire in the abdomen, east of Jabalia, in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. The soldiers also fired live rounds and gas bombs at medics trying to reach the child to provide him with the urgently needed medical help, before he succumbed to his wounds. Dr. Ashraf al-Qedra, the spokesperson of the Health Ministry In Gaza, said the soldiers shot 66 Palestinians, including 15 children and six women, in addition to two medics. It added that one of the wounded Palestinians suffered life-threatening wounds. The Health Ministry also stated that the soldiers shot two medics and caused others to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. The protests took place in five areas in the eastern parts of the Gaza Strip, from Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia, in the northern part, to Gaza city and central Gaza, in addition to Khan Younis and Rafah, in the southern part of the coastal region. Media sources in Gaza said the army used high-velocity gas bombs, and live fire, targeting many areas far away from the perimeter fence. They added that the soldiers also targeted several ambulances, medics and journalists, with sniper fire, in addition to the high-velocity gas bombs. The protests this week were also in support and solidarity with the Israeli occupation soldiers fired, Sunday, dozens of gas bombs into several schools, and surrounding areas in Hebron city, in the southern part of the occupied West Bank, causing dozens of schoolchildren and teachers, to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. Media sources said dozens of soldiers invaded the southern area of Hebron city, and fired a barrage of gas bombs into several schools, and their surrounding areas. Dozens of schoolchildren, and several teachers, suffered the effects of teargas inhalation and received the needed medical treatment. The Israeli army claimed several Palestinians hurled stones at the military vehicles, however, the schools and many homes in southern Hebron, especially around the Ibrahimi Mosque, are subject to constant violations not only by the soldiers, but also by the illegal Israeli colonists who frequently attack the residents, especially the students while heading to school or returning to their homes, in addition to the Palestinian homes and property. In related news, the soldiers abducted Sari and Yousef al-Akel, from Beit Ola town, while walking in Tal Romedia neighborhood in the center of Hebron city. Also on Sunday, the soldiers caused dozens of schoolchildren to suffer the severe effects of teargas inhalation in a school in Orif village, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus. Israeli occupation soldiers caused, Sunday, dozens of Palestinian schoolchildren to suffer the severe effects of teargas inhalation in a school in Orif village, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus. Media sources said the soldiers invaded the village, before storming the local high school, and fired a barrage of gas bombs at students protesting the invasion, causing dozens to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. Medics rushed to the school and provided the wounded students with the urgently needed medical attention, and moved many of them to a local medical center for further treatment. It is worth mentioning that the school has been a target of frequent attacks and violations by Israeli soldiers and illegal colonialist settlers and was shut down six times this current semester. The latest assault was carried out after illegal Israeli colonists from Yitzhar colony, which was built on Palestinian lands, attacked the village and several surrounding village, and damaged to cars in addition to causing fractures to one Palestinian. Israeli occupation soldiers abducted, on Sunday at dawn, at least fifteen Palestinians, including the governor of occupied East Jerusalem, after storming their homes and ransacking them, in several parts of the West Bank. The Palestinian Prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 Society (PPS) has reported that the soldiers abducted Jerusalem governor, Adnan Gheith, who was previously repeatedly abducted, interrogated and imprisoned, in addition to four Palestinians, identified as Mohammad Samir Obeid, Bashar Mheisin, Tajuddin Maher Mheisin and Mohammad Omran Obeid. It is worth mentioning that, after abducting the governor several times since October of 2018, the Israeli army issued orders barring him from entering the West Bank for six months. In Tulkarem, in northern West Bank, the soldiers invaded and searched homes in Far\xe2\x80\x99un town, south of the city, and abducted Islam Jihad \xe2\x80\x98Adwan, Ezzeddin Mohammad Hamed, Wasim Samir Farkh, Shadi Tal\xe2\x80\x99at Toheimer and Hamoud Mohammad Hamed. In Hebron, in southern West Bank, the soldiers also invaded and searched homes and abducted four Palestinians, identified as Amin Khalil as-Sous and Hayel Ishaq Rajoub, from Doura town, south of Hebron, in addition to Zeineddin Nafeth Jaradat and Hamada Hasan Jaradat, both fifteen years of age, from Sa\xe2\x80\x99ir town, east of the city. Furthermore, the soldiers invaded Teqoua\xe2\x80\x99 town, southeast of Bethlehem, and summoned Sami Ali Sabah, 24, for interrogation in Etzion military base, south of the city.

Thus, PCHR reiterates its call upon the ICC Prosecutor to open an official investigation in these crimes and to prosecute and hold accountable all those applying or involved in issuing orders within the Israeli Forces at the security and political echelons. PCHR also emphasizes that the High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention should fulfill their obligation under Article 1; i.e., to respect and ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances and their obligations under Article 146 to prosecute persons alleged to commit grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention. PCHR calls upon Switzerland, in its capacity as the Depository State for the Convention, to demand the High Contracting Parties to convene a meeting and ensure Israel\xe2\x80\x99s respect for this Convention, noting that these grave breaches constitute war crimes under Article 147 of the same Convention and Protocol (I) Additional to the Geneva Conventions regarding the guarantee of Palestinian civilians\xe2\x80\x99 right to protection in the occupied territories.
