[operation] is hit in [Teteto Beach is #1 again at Japan Marine Diving Fair  (MVA) — For the second straight year, Teteto Beach on the island of Rota in the Marianas was selected as the No. 1 Readers’ Choice Best Beach at the Dive and Travel Awards of the annual Marine Diving Fair in Japan on April 5-7, 2019.  In addition, Megumi Takaku of Blue Palms Dive Service Rota won 1st place Readers’ Choice Favorite Dive Guide, Overseas, adding accolades to her 2nd place last year, and Blue Palms won 2nd place, Readers’ Choice Favorite Dive Operator, Overseas.  “Once again, Rota is setting the standard in the industry for extraordinary dive and beach experiences and exceptional customer care,” said Marianas Visitors Authority Managing Director Christopher A. Concepcion. ““I, myself, have had the privilege of diving in Rota, and I have to say that Rota has the best visibility of any of the islands in the Marianas. The coral reefs, sea life and unique underwater formations make Rota a dive haven. We can all look to the care of the Rota community for the cleanliness and protection of their natural resources and to their hospitality and care for each visitor as an example of what we can offer visitors to each of the islands of the Marianas. We have much to be proud of.”  In addition, Saipan, Tinian, and Rota combined won 4th place for the second year in a row as Readers’ Choice Best Diving Area, Overseas, and Managaha won 10th place in Readers’ Choice Best Beach.  Diving opportunities on Rota and throughout the Marianas were touted by MVA to over 50,000 attendees at the fair, which is Japan’s leading consumer diving show, targeting consumers and trade representatives in Japan and other Asian countries. The fair was held at Ikebukuro Sunshine City Convention Center in Tokyo.  MVA hosted an information booth at the event in the “Ocean, Islands and Travel” section. MVA showed the movie “Diving in the Marianas,” distributed diving maps and leaflets, island maps, and other material; and answered questions from attendees at the show, which attracted 100 exhibitors representing destinations, diving shops, underwater camera manufacturers, and other areas of the industry.  In cooperation with MVA, the event was also attended by four members of the Northern Marianas Diving Operations Association.]

[ congress ] is hit in [Kalavathi was scared when she was asked to join a group of relatives and friends to go to Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala for Vishukani darshan at the Lord Ayyappa temple on 15 April. The 32-year-old woman from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu found her fears misplaced when she found none to block her at the Nilakkal base camp on the eve of the Vishu, the Malayalam New Year day.  This was not the case six months ago, when workers of right-wing outfits forced the women who between 10 and 50 years of age to return. The protesters had also taken position at other entry points and the entire hillock to ensure that no menstruating women entered the temple.  The protests following the 28 September Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all ages to enter the temple turned violent most when the temple was opened for the monthly puja and during the main pilgrim season. Hundreds of people, including police and media personnel, had come under attack from the self-styled guardians of the customs and traditions of the temple.  Kalavathi was afraid to visit Sabarimala as she had read reports about the violence. However, she was relieved when she did not find any protesters in the vicinity of Sabarimala when they arrived as Nilakkal. Police personnel posted at the base camp said that protesters belonging to all political hues had disappeared from the hill shrine following the announcement of the election.  “They seem to have abandoned Ayyappa for the sake of votes. It is now clear that all the drama that Sabarimala witnessed after the Supreme Court passed the order was political,” said an officer who did not want to be identified.  Bharatiya Janata Party general secretary K Surendran, who was at the forefront of the protests, is now the BJP candidate in the Pathanamthitta Lok Sabha constituency. When asked why they have dropped the vigil at Sabarimala, he said they did not feel the need for the same as the Left Front government itself had abandoned their decision to take women of the forbidden age to Sabarimala.  “We had entered the scene after Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan appeared adamant in implementing the apex court verdict. He has realised the folly of his decision and has refrained from taking young women to the hill shrine. Therefore, there is no need for us to guard the temple now,” he said.  Surendran said that the protests they organised had also created awareness among the devotees about the evil designs of the government. “They themselves are coming forward to protect the customs and traditions of the temple without anybody prompting them,” he added.  However, Surendran and his party are not ready to leave Sabarimala in the election, despite a bar on invoking the names of Lord Ayyappa in the election by the Election Commission. Women’s entry into the temple is the single largest issue of Surendran at Pathanamthitta, which is a Congress bastion. Without mentioning the name of the deity, Surendran has been seeking votes for Ayyappan.  “I know you have gathered here braving the scorching summer heat not because of your love for me. I don’t need to tell you who has brought you here. Please vote for him and teach the Left a lesson,” Surendran told a moderate crowd of men and women who had gathered near Konni, 40 kms from Nilakkal, to greet him.  Before he reached the spot, the local leaders described him as a 'martyr'. They pointed out that 242 cases slapped by the Kerala police against him in connection with the Sabarimala issue was part of the government’s attempt to silence those fighting for the rights of the faithful.  If the faithful consider the personal struggle waged by him in defending the customs and traditions of the Sabarimala temple genuine, K Surendran should win the election hands down. However, it is no cake walk for the BJP candidate.  Many of the faithful have started realising that the aggressive stand that Surendran and his party had taken against the LDF government’s attempt to implement the apex court verdict was not borne out of genuine concern for faith but aimed at political capital.  The Nair Service Society (NSS), a community organisation of the upper caste Nairs that appreciated the support given by the Sangh Parivar in opposing the entry of young women in the temple, has chosen not to reciprocate the support in the political arena. The organisation that holds sway over the 14 percent Nair population in the district has decided to continue with its policy of maintaining equi-distance from both the Left and the Right.  Sabarimala Karma Samithi patron Swami Chidanandapuri’s call to the Ayyappa devotees to vote for the Congress-led United Democratic Front’s candidates in constituencies where the NDA is weak has also come as a setback to the BJP’s efforts to use the issue to strengthen the party base in the state.  Though the opinion on social media was intended to ensure the defeat of the LDF, senior BJP leaders fear that the confusion it creates will affect the party’s prospects in marginal seats.  BJP was counting on the support of NSS for the victory of Surendran at Pathanamthitta. Sources in the organisation said that the NSS leadership was not happy with the way Surendran, in particular, and the saffron party in general dragged the issue into the streets. NSS' official journal Service accused all political parties of trying to use Sabarimala for their electoral gains.  The NSS journal also doubts the sincerity of the BJP in finding a legal solution to the issue. In its editorial, Service said that the party had tried to prevent women on the streets instead of paying attention to the legal matters. The NSS leadership is also not impressed by the promise given by the BJP in its election manifesto to secure constitutional protection on issues related to faith and belief since it did nothing to fulfil its promise regarding the Ram temple at Ayodhya during its term. He said that the BJP cannot fool the people in Kerala with such empty words.  BJP can win the seat only if it is able to pool the votes of the entire majority community, which accounts for about 57 percent of the population in the district. None expects the entire Hindu votes to fall in the BJP kitty since a substantial chunk of them have been traditional supporters of UDF and LDF and it won’t be easy for them to change political affiliations based on one issue.  “I know what the government has done at Sabarimala was not right. I am also hurt by the haste with which the government tried to implement the SC verdict. However, I cannot think of changing my political affiliation as I and my family have been supporting the Communist Party of India from my childhood. I will vote for the party candidate this time too,” said Govinga Pillai, a 75-year-old trader near Konni.  However, his wife Lalitha said she would not vote for the CPM this time. But she has not been able to decide whether to vote for BJP or Congress. She said many of her friends in the area were also confused like her. “We will take a decision after seeing the campaign,” said Lalitha.  Congress has been winning the seat ever since the constituency was carved out in 2009 with the support of a section of the Nair community and the minorities, who account for 43 percent of the population. However, party candidate Anto Antony’s victory margin saw a drop from 1,11,206 votes in 2009 to 56,191 votes in 2014.  This was mainly due to an improved showing by the BJP, which increased its vote share from 7.08 percent to 15.98 percent votes during the period. A swing in minority votes in the 2016 Assembly election saw the LDF winning four Assembly segments.  However, the Congress camp expects that the moderate sections of the majority community will support the UDF, making Anto’s victory easy. The LDF camp is pinning their hope on the progressive sections of the society. A tour across the constituency, comprising four Assembly segments in Pathanamthitta district and two in Kottayam district, show their number too short for a victory for Veena George, the LDF candidate.  The fight in Pathanamthitta is between BJP and the Congress. It is too early to predict who will have the last laugh in this extremely close fight.

Surendran said that the protests they organised had also created awareness among the devotees about the evil designs of the government. “They themselves are coming forward to protect the customs and traditions of the temple without anybody prompting them,” he added.  However, Surendran and his party are not ready to leave Sabarimala in the election, despite a bar on invoking the names of Lord Ayyappa in the election by the Election Commission. Women’s entry into the temple is the single largest issue of Surendran at Pathanamthitta, which is a Congress bastion. Without mentioning the name of the deity, Surendran has been seeking votes for Ayyappan.  “I know you have gathered here braving the scorching summer heat not because of your love for me. I don’t need to tell you who has brought you here. Please vote for him and teach the Left a lesson,” Surendran told a moderate crowd of men and women who had gathered near Konni, 40 kms from Nilakkal, to greet him.  Before he reached the spot, the local leaders described him as a 'martyr'. They pointed out that 242 cases slapped by the Kerala police against him in connection with the Sabarimala issue was part of the government’s attempt to silence those fighting for the rights of the faithful.  If the faithful consider the personal struggle waged by him in defending the customs and traditions of the Sabarimala temple genuine, K Surendran should win the election hands down. However, it is no cake walk for the BJP candidate.  Many of the faithful have started realising that the aggressive stand that Surendran and his party had taken against the LDF government’s attempt to implement the apex court verdict was not borne out of genuine concern for faith but aimed at political capital.  The Nair Service Society (NSS), a community organisation of the upper caste Nairs that appreciated the support given by the Sangh Parivar in opposing the entry of young women in the temple, has chosen not to reciprocate the support in the political arena. The organisation that holds sway over the 14 percent Nair population in the district has decided to continue with its policy of maintaining equi-distance from both the Left and the Right.  Sabarimala Karma Samithi patron Swami Chidanandapuri’s call to the Ayyappa devotees to vote for the Congress-led United Democratic Front’s candidates in constituencies where the NDA is weak has also come as a setback to the BJP’s efforts to use the issue to strengthen the party base in the state.  Though the opinion on social media was intended to ensure the defeat of the LDF, senior BJP leaders fear that the confusion it creates will affect the party’s prospects in marginal seats.  BJP was counting on the support of NSS for the victory of Surendran at Pathanamthitta. Sources in the organisation said that the NSS leadership was not happy with the way Surendran, in particular, and the saffron party in general dragged the issue into the streets. NSS' official journal Service accused all political parties of trying to use Sabarimala for their electoral gains.  The NSS journal also doubts the sincerity of the BJP in finding a legal solution to the issue. In its editorial, Service said that the party had tried to prevent women on the streets instead of paying attention to the legal matters. The NSS leadership is also not impressed by the promise given by the BJP in its election manifesto to secure constitutional protection on issues related to faith and belief since it did nothing to fulfil its promise regarding the Ram temple at Ayodhya during its term. He said that the BJP cannot fool the people in Kerala with such empty words.  BJP can win the seat only if it is able to pool the votes of the entire majority community, which accounts for about 57 percent of the population in the district. None expects the entire Hindu votes to fall in the BJP kitty since a substantial chunk of them have been traditional supporters of UDF and LDF and it won’t be easy for them to change political affiliations based on one issue.  “I know what the government has done at Sabarimala was not right. I am also hurt by the haste with which the government tried to implement the SC verdict. However, I cannot think of changing my political affiliation as I and my family have been supporting the Communist Party of India from my childhood. I will vote for the party candidate this time too,” said Govinga Pillai, a 75-year-old trader near Konni.  However, his wife Lalitha said she would not vote for the CPM this time. But she has not been able to decide whether to vote for BJP or Congress. She said many of her friends in the area were also confused like her. “We will take a decision after seeing the campaign,” said Lalitha.  Congress has been winning the seat ever since the constituency was carved out in 2009 with the support of a section of the Nair community and the minorities, who account for 43 percent of the population. However, party candidate Anto Antony’s victory margin saw a drop from 1,11,206 votes in 2009 to 56,191 votes in 2014.  This was mainly due to an improved showing by the BJP, which increased its vote share from 7.08 percent to 15.98 percent votes during the period. A swing in minority votes in the 2016 Assembly election saw the LDF winning four Assembly segments.  However, the Congress camp expects that the moderate sections of the majority community will support the UDF, making Anto’s victory easy. The LDF camp is pinning their hope on the progressive sections of the society. A tour across the constituency, comprising four Assembly segments in Pathanamthitta district and two in Kottayam district, show their number too short for a victory for Veena George, the LDF candidate.  The fight in Pathanamthitta is between BJP and the Congress. It is too early to predict who will have the last laugh in this extremely close fight.

[ appointment] is hit in [KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 — The trial of former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s case involving RM42 million of SRC International Sdn Bhd funds will continue tomorrow with his defence team to cross-examine the first witness.  On April 3, High Court Judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali set April 15 until May 10 to continue the trial of Najib, who is Pekan Member of Parliament.  The high profile trial would continue with counsel Harvinderjit Singh representing Najib to cross-examine the first witness, Muhammad Akmaludin Abdullah, 35, assistant registrar of Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM).  On the first day of trial, Muhammad Akmaludin told the court that SRC International Sdn Bhd, had a paid capital of RM1 million when it registered with the SSM on January 7, 2011, and checks on the shareholders also found that all one million shares were held by the Finance Ministry (Incorporated).  Najib, 66, is facing three counts of criminal breach of trust, one charge of abusing his position and three counts of money laundering over SRC International Sdn Bhd funds amounting to RM42 million.  He is alleged to have committed the offences at AmIslamic Bank Berhad in Jalan Raja Chulan and the Prime Minister’s Office in Putrajaya between August 17, 2011, and February 10, 2015.  Najib, who is the sixth prime minister of Malaysia, is the first to find himself in the accused dock.  Attorney-General Tommy Thomas in his opening statement on the first day of trial, among others, said the prosecution will prove that Najib had used his position as Prime Minister and Minister of Finance to obtain for himself a gratification of RM42 million.  “It is my duty and privilege of opening the first trial in our courts against a former prime minister who, for nearly a decade, occupied the most powerful office in the land and wielded near absolute power.  “Such privilege carries with it enormous responsibility, which my office intends to discharge in order to establish that the accused is guilty of the seven charges that he is facing before your lordship.  “The accused during his entire period in office as Prime Minister of which time these offences were committed simultaneously held the office of Minister of Finance, thereby combining maximum political power and control of the nation’s purse,” he said.  Thomas also said “the operation of Article 8 (1) of the Federal Constitution that ‘all persons are equal before the law’ is amply demonstrated by this trial”.  “A former Prime Minister is charged under due process in the ordinary court of the land, like any other accused. The accused is not above the law and his prosecution and this trial should serve as precedents for all future holders of this august office,” he said.  Following are among others key ingredients in the prosecution’s opening statement read out by Thomas.  The prosecution will abundantly establish that the accused was directly involved in the decision on behalf of the Government of Malaysia to give government guarantees for the loans amounting to RM4 billion received by SRC International Sdn Bhd from Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) (“KWAP”).  The evidence will also establish that in December 2014, the accused’s credit card was charged US$130,625 (RM537,456) for expenses made at Chanel, an exclusive fashion store in Honolulu.  The prosecution will prove that personal cheques were issued, among others, as payment for renovation works carried out at the accused’s residence at Jalan Langgak Duta, Kuala Lumpur, the accused’s residence in Pekan, Pahang as well as cheques were issued to various Barisan Nasional component political parties.  In proving the ingredients on the charge of abusing his position, evidence, both oral, documentary and circumstantial would be led by the prosecution to establish the proposed establishment of SRC International Sdn Bhd, the proposed setting-up of a RM3 billion grant, SRC International’s request for a government loan for RM3.95 billion, appointments of SRC International’s Board of Directors, and one Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil as CEO of SRC International.  The prosecution will also establish on matters that led to the approval of the Malaysian government, through the Ministry of Finance, the issuance of a RM2 billion government guarantee in favour of SRC International and for the issuance of a further RM2 billion government guarantee in favour of the company (SRC International).  The evidence will also be led regarding monies totalling RM42 million, sourced from SRC International, were channelled through the company accounts of Gandingan Mentari Sdn Bhd (a wholly-owned subsidiary of SRC International Sdn Bhd) and Ihsan Perdana Sdn Bhd (purportedly appointed as SRC International’s corporate social responsibility partner).  For the criminal breach of trust (CBT) charges, the prosecution will establish that Najib, as Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and Advisor Emeritus of SRC International, whilst entrusted with monies belonging to SRC International, committed CBT in respect of the RM27 million, RM5 million and RM10 million belonging to SRC International.  The prosecution will also provide evidence that Najib had engaged in money laundering by receiving RM42 million, being the proceeds of unlawful activity, in his AmPrivate Banking account.  The evidence would also be led that Najib had issued 15 cheques from his bank account totalling RM10,776,514.00. — Bernama]

Mayam said that the six large packs of suspected shabu confiscated from Resurection had an estimated Dangerous Drugs Board value of P3.4 million.  He said that they had monitored the suspect for three weeks after they got information about the his illegal activities from a suspected drug courier in one of their anti-illegal drug operations in the past month.  He said that they learned that the suspect was allegedly a drug user, a drug courier and was allegedly linked to a group headed by a drug lord operating within the city.  Mayam, however, refused to name the suspected drug lord that Resurection was linked to.  Resurection was detained at the Abellana Police Precinct detention cell pending the filing of charges.  At past 4 a.m. on Sunday, April 14, three persons were arrested including one, whom police considered a high value target in a buy-bust operation in a rented apartment in a subdivision in Barangay Bulacao, Cebu City.  Archie Abellana also known as Archie Bayot, 39, of Barangay Suba in Cebu City; Marjory Arriesgado, 33, of Sitio Cabotoy, Barangay Pooc in Talisay City; and Lendon Gonzaga, 37, of Barangay Bulacao in Cebu City; were arrested after they were caught with P1.1 million worth of suspected shabu, said Police Major Regino Maramag, Pardo Police Precinct chief, in a separate interview with CDN Digital.  Maramag said that Abellana, allegedly was the head of a drug syndicate and who had been in and out of jail while his two alleged cohorts, Arriesgado and Gonzaga were allegedly Abellana’s trusted aides and couriers.  He said that they confiscated 168.14 grams of suspected shabu from the suspects which had an estimated DDB value of P1.1 million.  The suspects were detained at the Pardo Police Precinct detention cell pending the filing of charges./dbs]

[ chemical ] is hit in [Gold is a chemical element with symbol Au and atomic number 79, making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element.  Where to Find Gold in the United States?  Gold was discovered in Alabama about 1830, shortly following the Georgia Gold Rush. The principal districts were the Arbacoochee district in Cleburne County, mostly from placer deposits, and the Hog Mountain district in Tallapoosa County, which produced 24,000 troy ounces (750 kg) from veins in schist.  Russian explorers discovered placer gold in the Kenai River in 1848, but no gold was produced. Gold mining started in 1870 from placers southeast of Juneau. Alaska produced a total of 40,300,000 troy ounces (1,250,000 kg) of gold from 1880 through the end of 2007. In 2015 Alaskan mines produced 873,984 troy ounces (27,183.9 kg) of gold, 12.7% of US production. The largest gold producer is the Fort Knox mine, a large open pit and cyanide leaching operation in the Fairbanks mining district.  Arizona has produced more than 16 million troy ounces (498 tonnes) of gold.  Gold mining in Arizona reportedly began in 1774 when Spanish priest Manuel Lopez directed Papago Indians to wash gold from gravel on the flanks of the Quijotoa Mountains, Pima County. Gold mining continued there until 1849, when the Mexican miners were lured away by the California Gold Rush. Other gold mining under Spanish and Mexican rule took place in the Oro Blanco district of Santa Cruz County, and the Arivaca district, Pima County.  Mountain man Pauline Weaver discovered placer gold on the east side of the Colorado River in 1862. Weaver’s discovery started the Colorado River Gold Rush to the now ghost town of La Paz, Arizona and other locations along the river in the ensuing years.  Spanish prospectors found gold in the Potholes district between 1775 and 1780, along the Colorado River, in present Imperial County, California, about ten miles northeast from Yuma, Arizona. The gold was recovered from dry placers. Other placer deposits on the west bank of the Colorado River were quickly found, including the Picacho and Cargo Muchacho districts.  Placer gold deposits were found at San Ysidro in San Diego County in 1828, San Francisquito Canyon and Placerita Canyon in Los Angeles County in 1835 and 1842, respectively  Major gold mining in California began during the California Gold Rush. Gold was found by James Marshall at Sutters Mill, property of John Sutter, in present-day Coloma. In 1849, people started hearing about the gold and after just a few years San Francisco’s population increased to thousands.  Gold was discovered in 1858 during the Pike’s Peak Gold Rush in the vicinity of present-day Denver in 1858, but the deposits were small. The first important gold discoveries in Colorado were in the Central City-Idaho Springs district in January 1859. Only one Colorado mine continues to produce gold, the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine at Victor near Colorado Springs, an open-pit heap leach operation owned by Newmont Mining Corporation, which produced 360,000 troy ounces (11,000 kg) of gold in 2018.  Small amounts of gold were mined commercially in North Eastern Florida during the late 19th Century, at the site where Mike Roess Gold Head Branch State Park is located today. No records are extant on the amount of gold produced, but the find was insufficient to keep the operation running commercially, and the small amount of pay dirt was depleted within a matter of months.  Georgia is credited with a total historical production of 871,000 troy ounces (27,100 kg) of gold from 1830 through 1959. Although historically important, the state is not currently a gold producer.  Gold was first discovered in Idaho in 1860, in Pierce at the juncture where Canal Creek meets Orofino Creek.  The leading historical gold-producing district is the Boise Basin in Boise County, which was discovered in 1862 and produced 2.9 million troy ounces (90.2 tonnes), mostly from placers.  The French Creek-Florence district in Idaho County began in the 1860s, and has produced about 1 million troy ounces (31 tonnes) from placers.  The Silver City district in Owyhee County began producing in 1863, and made over 1 million troy ounces (31 tonnes), mostly from lode deposits.  The Coeur d’Alene district in Shoshone County has made 44,000 troy ounces (1,400 kg) of gold as byproduct to silver mining.  In 2006, active gold mines in Idaho included the Silver Strand mine and the Bond mine.  Gold was reported in Maryland as early as 1830, but no production resulted. Placer gold was discovered at Great Falls near Washington, DC in 1861 during the American Civil War by Union soldiers from California. After the war a number of mines were opened on gold-bearing quartz veins in Montgomery County. No gold production has been reported since 1951. Total production was about 6,000 troy ounces (190 kg).  Approximately 29,000 troy ounces (900 kg) of gold were produced from the Ropes gold mine northeast of Ishpeming in Marquette County, Michigan. The underground mine, originally operated from 1880 to 1897, and reopened from 1983–1989, extracted gold from quartz veins in peridotite.  Gold was first discovered in Montana in 1852, but mining did not begin until 1862, when gold placers were discovered at Bannack, Montana in 1862. The resulting gold rush resulted in more placer discoveries, including those at Virginia City in 1863, and at Helena and Butte in 1864. In 1867, the Atlantic Cable Quartz Lode was located.  The Butte district, although mined primarily for copper, produced 2.9 million ounces (91 tones) of gold through 1990, almost all as a byproduct of copper production.  Current active hardrock gold mines include the Montana Tunnels mine, and the Golden Sunlight mine. Active gold placers include the Browns Gulch placer and the Confederate Gulch placer. Gold is also produced from three platinum mines in the Stillwater igneous complex: the Stillwater mine, the Lodestar mine, and the East Boulder Project.  Nevada is the leading gold-producing state in the nation, in 2016 producing 5,467,646 troy ounces (170.06 tonnes), representing 81% of US gold and 5.5% of the world’s production. Much of the gold in Nevada comes from large open pit mining and with heap leaching recovery. Some of the world’s major mining companies, including Newmont Mining, Barrick Gold and Kinross Gold, operate gold mines in the state. Active major mines include Cortez, Twin Creeks, Betz-Post, Meikle, Marigold, Round Mountain, Jerritt Canyon and Getchell.  Newmont and Barrick operate the largest mining operations, on the prolific Carlin Trend, one of the world’s richest mining districts.  Gold was first discovered in New Mexico in 1828 in the “Old Placers” district in the Ortiz Mountains, Santa Fe County, New Mexico. The placer gold discovery was followed by discovery of a nearby lode deposit.  In 1877, two prospectors collected float in the area of the future Opportunity Mine near Hillsboro, New Mexico, which was assayed at $160 per ton in gold and silver. Soon, ore was discovered at the nearby Rattlesnake vein and a placer deposit of gold was found in November at the Rattlesnake and Wicks gulches. Total production prior to 1904 was about $6,750,000.  In 2007 all gold production in New Mexico (13,000 troy ounces (400 kg)) came as a byproduct of copper mining from two large open pit mines in Grant County. However, two primary gold mines are being readied for production: the Northstar mine in Rio Arriba County, and the San Lorenzo Claims mine in Socorro County.  North Carolina was the site of the first gold rush in the United States, following the discovery of a 17-pound (7.7 kg) gold nugget by 12-year-old Conrad Reed in a creek at his father’s farm in 1799. The Reed Gold Mine, southwest of Georgeville in Cabarrus County, North Carolina produced about 50,000 troy ounces (1,600 kg) of gold from lode and placer deposits.  Gold was produced from 15 districts, almost all in the Piedmont region of the state. Total gold production is estimated at 1.2 million troy ounces (37.3 tonnes).  Although gold mines are spread over much of Oregon, almost all of the gold produced has come from two principal areas: the Klamath Mountains in southwest Oregon, including Coos, Curry, Douglas, Jackson and Josephine counties; and the Blue Mountains in northeast Oregon, mostly in Baker and Grant counties.  Prospectors from Illinois discovered placer gold in the Klamath Mountains of southwest Oregon in 1850, starting a rush to the area. Lode gold deposits were also discovered.  Travellers along the Oregon Trail bound for the Willamette Valley are said to have discovered gold in northeastern Oregon in 1845, but mining in earnest did not begin until 1861.  About 37,000 troy ounces (1,200 kg) of gold was produced from the Cornwall iron mine five miles south of Lebanon, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. Although the deposit produced iron since 1742, no gold was reported from the mine until 1878.  South Carolina had a number of lode gold mines along the Carolina Slate Belt.[38]  The Haile deposit was discovered in Lancaster County in 1827, and at least 257,000 troy ounces (8,000 kg) of gold were extracted intermittently between then and 1942, when the gold mine was ordered closed as nonessential to the war effort. Beginning in 1951, the deposit was mined for associated sericite, which was used as a white filler.  The only operating gold mine in South Dakota is the Wharf mine, at Lead, an open pit heap leach operation operated by Coeur Mining that produced 109,000 ounces of gold in 2016.  Placer gold was discovered on Coker Creek in Monroe County, Tennessee in 1827. The district produced about 9,000 troy ounces (280 kg).  About 15,000 troy ounces (470 kg) of gold was recovered from the massive sulfide copper ores at Ducktown, Tennessee.  Some prospects have been excavated for gold on the Llano Uplift of central Texas. Gold prospects include the Heath mine and the Babyhead district, both in Llano County, and the Central Texas mine in Gillespie County. Gold production, if any, is not known. Historically, the Lost Nigger Gold Mine may be in Texas.  Most gold produced in Utah today is a byproduct of the huge Bingham Canyon copper mine, southwest of Salt Lake City. In 2013, the Bingham Canyon mine produced 192,300 troy ounces (5,980 kg) of gold. Over its life, Bingham Canyon has produced more than 23 million ounces (715 tonnes) of gold, making it one of the largest gold producers in the US.  The Barneys Canyon mine in Salt Lake County, the last primary gold mine to operate in Utah, stopped mining in 2001, but is still recovering gold from its heap leaching pads. Utah gold production was 460,000 troy ounces (14,000 kg) in 2006.  Most gold mining in Virginia was concentrated in the Virginia Gold-Pyrite belt in a line that runs northeast to southwest through the counties of Fairfax, Prince William, Stafford, Fauquier, Culpeper, Spotsylvania, Orange, Louisa, Fluvanna, Goochland, Cumberland, and Buckingham. Some gold was also mined in Halifax, Floyd, and Patrick counties.  Gold was first discovered in Washington in 1853, as placer deposits in the Yakima Valley. Production from the state never exceeded 50,000 troy ounces per year until the mid-1930s, when large hard rock deposits were developed near the Chelan Lake and Wenatchee deposits in Chelan County, and the Republic deposit in Ferry County. Production through 1965 is estimated to be 2.3 million ounces.  Gold was discovered at the South Pass-Atlantic City-Sweetwater district in present Fremont County in 1842. The placers were worked intermittently until 1867, when the first important gold vein was discovered, and prospectors and miners rushed to the area.. The towns of South Pass City, Atlantic City, and Miner’s Delight catered to the miners. The district was nearly deserted by 1875, and was worked only intermittently afterward. Total gold production was about 300,000 troy ounces (9,300 kg). In 1962, the district became the site of a major iron mine.  The first significant gold rush in the United States was in Cabarrus County, North Carolina (east of Charlotte), in 1799 at today’s Reed’s Gold Mine. Thirty years later, in 1829, the Georgia Gold Rush in the southern Appalachians occurred. It was followed by the California Gold Rush of 1848–55 in the Sierra Nevada, which captured the popular imagination.  The California gold rush led directly to the settlement of California by Americans and the rapid entry of that state into the union in 1850. The gold rush in 1849 stimulated worldwide interest in prospecting for gold, and led to new rushes in Australia, South Africa, Wales and Scotland.  Successive gold rushes occurred in western North America: Fraser Canyon, the Cariboo district and other parts of British Columbia, in Nevada, in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, eastern Oregon, and western New Mexico Territory and along the lower Colorado River. Resurrection Creek, near Hope, Alaska was the site of Alaska’s first gold rush in the mid–1890s. Other notable Alaska Gold Rushes were Nome, Fairbanks, and the Fortymile River.  One of the last “great gold rushes” was the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada’s Yukon Territory (1896–99). This gold rush is immortalised in the novels of Jack London, and Charlie Chaplin’s film The Gold Rush. Robert William Service depicted with talent in his poetries the dramatic event of the Gold Rush, especially in the book The Trail of ’98. The main goldfield was along the south flank of the Klondike River near its confluence with the Yukon River near what was to become Dawson City in Canada’s Yukon Territory, but it also helped open up the relatively new US possession of Alaska to exploration and settlement, and promoted the discovery of other gold finds.]

The placers were worked intermittently until 1867, when the first important gold vein was discovered, and prospectors and miners rushed to the area.. The towns of South Pass City, Atlantic City, and Miner’s Delight catered to the miners. The district was nearly deserted by 1875, and was worked only intermittently afterward. Total gold production was about 300,000 troy ounces (9,300 kg). In 1962, the district became the site of a major iron mine.  The first significant gold rush in the United States was in Cabarrus County, North Carolina (east of Charlotte), in 1799 at today’s Reed’s Gold Mine. Thirty years later, in 1829, the Georgia Gold Rush in the southern Appalachians occurred. It was followed by the California Gold Rush of 1848–55 in the Sierra Nevada, which captured the popular imagination.  The California gold rush led directly to the settlement of California by Americans and the rapid entry of that state into the union in 1850. The gold rush in 1849 stimulated worldwide interest in prospecting for gold, and led to new rushes in Australia, South Africa, Wales and Scotland.  Successive gold rushes occurred in western North America: Fraser Canyon, the Cariboo district and other parts of British Columbia, in Nevada, in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, eastern Oregon, and western New Mexico Territory and along the lower Colorado River. Resurrection Creek, near Hope, Alaska was the site of Alaska’s first gold rush in the mid–1890s. Other notable Alaska Gold Rushes were Nome, Fairbanks, and the Fortymile River.  One of the last “great gold rushes” was the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada’s Yukon Territory (1896–99). This gold rush is immortalised in the novels of Jack London, and Charlie Chaplin’s film The Gold Rush. Robert William Service depicted with talent in his poetries the dramatic event of the Gold Rush, especially in the book The Trail of ’98. The main goldfield was along the south flank of the Klondike River near its confluence with the Yukon River near what was to become Dawson City in Canada’s Yukon Territory, but it also helped open up the relatively new US possession of Alaska to exploration and settlement, and promoted the discovery of other gold finds.]

[ attack ] is hit in [Laleh Shahravesh spent 33 days detained in the emirate before becoming the first British citizen to be convicted under the UAE's strict cyber crime laws. The wife had reported her to police for two social media messages posted on Facebook in 2016. She was finally reunited with her 14-year-old daughter Paris in the arrivals hall at Heathrow on Friday, following an international outcry over her treatment. Laleh, 55, from Richmond, Surrey, wept as she admitted: "The day before I was told I was free to go I'd given up hope and was suicidal. "I felt like I was never going to see my daughter again and sent a message to my sister saying 'I can't do this anymore'. I told her 'It's killing me, every day is killing me. I felt so much pain and then I turned off my phone. I could see my whole life flashing before my eyes and I just wanted to die. It was torture to me."  Laleh, a privately educated doctor's daughter, was arrested at Dubai International Airport on March 10 after she and Paris travelled to the emirate so they could grieve at the graveside of Laleh's ex-husband Pedro Correia Dos Santos after he died of a heart attack aged 51, seven days earlier. At passport control Laleh was hauled away by police, who told her that her ex's new wife had made a legal complaint about two Facebook posts, including one where she had been described as "a horse". Laleh said: "I couldn't understand what was happening and then a police officer came in and said 'There's a complaint against you - do you know Samah al Hammadi?' "I just burst into tears. I had been arrested for two Facebook posts made in the UK three years ago. "I still had no idea about what was going to unfold and the full extent of the trouble I was in. I just thought 'This will all be fine and over by tomorrow'."  Laleh spent 12 hours at a police station where she was ordered to sign a statement, despite it being in Arabic and her having no understanding of what it said. She later discovered the translation of the Facebook post bore no relation to what she had written, with a swear word substituted for the word "horse". The posts, which Laleh wrote after seeing a photo of her ex-husband getting married to his new Tunisian lover Samah al Hammadi, 42, said: "I hope you go under the ground you idiot. Damn you. You left me for this horse" and "You married a horse you idiot". She said: "I know I shouldn't have posted the messages, but at the time I was distraught. "It had never occurred to me and took me completely by surprise. I was being arrested for calling her a horse, I thought 'this is nonsense'."  Laleh, who was educated at Tormead School in Guildford, Surrey, and used to work for London auctioneers Bonhams, was told she was being held in Dubai while she awaited a court hearing. It was at that point she made the heartbreaking decision to send Paris home on her own. Laleh said: "Paris was absolutely terrified. I thought 'I can't subject her to one more minute of this'. "I'm still getting shakes now thinking about that moment because I think that was when I realised everything had become real. "It was the single hardest thing I've ever had to do. "Her father had died less than two weeks earlier and now she was losing her mother. I felt like I was failing her as a parent, but I knew I had no power over the situation."  On Thursday, after Paris wrote a touching letter to Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai and prime minister of the UAE, Laleh finally appeared before the Dubai Court of Misdemeanours. Judge Mohamed Mustafa Ibrahim Khalil said she could be released from the country if she paid a £624 fine. She said: "It felt like I was dreaming and I didn't believe it was real. "I burst into tears of happiness and disbelief when I got my passport, but I didn't allow myself to believe it was all really all over until I got on the plane. I just felt numb." After being put on a flight from Dubai in the early hours of Friday morning she was finally reunited with Paris at Heathrow. Laleh said: "The moment I saw Paris at the airport was such an overwhelming moment. My heart was aching for her and being able to hold my girl again was so emotional.  "I'll never forget that moment. Being apart from her had been brutal. "I still feel like I'm in a daze and I feel like a fraction of the person I was before. "This last month has completely broken me physically and mentally, it has traumatised me. "I just want to enjoy life with Paris now and cherish every moment."]

[ knife ] is hit in [One of Australia's most notorious serial rapists known as 'Mr Cruel' could very well still be alive 28 years after terrorising Melbourne, investigators have revealed.  The serial predator and suspected killer is believed to be responsible for raping and kidnapping at least a dozen young girls across the city in the late 1980s and early 90s - and to this day has never been caught or identified.  Two girls kidnapped by Mr Cruel - Sharon Wills, ten, and Nicola Lynas, 13 - were eventually released, but 13-year-old Karmein Chan's remains were found a year after her abduction. She had been shot three times in the head.  Australian Crime Stories revisited the Melbourne schoolgirl's case on the 28th anniversary of her abduction and murder on Sunday night.  Karmein's case stood out from all the others because she was the only victim to be killed by the rapist after she was taken.

Mr Cruel attacked girls as young as 11 in ­Melbourne in the 1980s and 1990s. The paedophile has never been identified. August 22, 1987, Lower Plenty: He broke into house in the night, locked the parents in a wardrobe and attacked their 11-year-old daughter December 27, 1988, Ringwood: He broke into a house, tied up the parents and abducted their 10-year-old daughter, releasing her at a school 18 hours later July 3, 1990, Canterbury: He broke into house and abducted a 13-year-old. He drove her to another house where he kept her for 50 hours before release. April 13, 1991 Templestowe: He broke into a house and abducted Karmein Chan, 13. Her body was found a year later.  'It doesn't make any sense. Good criminals, offenders, serial offenders, they don't get scared off. They believe, their ego believes they're better than the system, they're better than investigators,' Dr Stephen Barron, psychologist and former police inspector said.  Although Mr Cruel had been perceived as a dark, mysterious figure in the public eye, investigators suggested the serial rapist could actually just be 'Mr Average.'  Following Karmein's abduction, Australian authorities had sought help from the American FBI - who revealed there was nothing particularly striking about Mr Cruel's profile.  He was believed to be between 20 and 50 years old, between 165 and 183cm tall, thin to medium build with a potbelly.  He also did not have a distinct accent and was described as quietly spoken.  Mr Cruel's weapon of choice was a knife and he was known to wear a balaclava and had taped over his victims' eyes to shield his identity.  Other theories suggest Karmein had been bold enough to rip off the tape from her eyes or had pulled Mr Cruel's mask off, revealing his identity and forcing him to kill her.  But some investigators say it is unlikely a serial offender would be 'scared off' and believe it is possible Mr Cruel went quiet because he left town to continue his attacks overseas or elsewhere.  'My suspicion is that he probably just left town or he went to jail and died,' Criminal psychologist Tim Watson Munro said.  'There were the Hillside Stranglers in Los Angeles. A guy and his cousin were abducting, raping and murdering women in the Hills district of LA, dumping the cadavers on the front lawns of places as all part of the horror show, and it stopped as abruptly as it started.  'He was eventually discovered in Oregon, so, he'd relocated, he'd gone further north, into a different state. It started again.'  Although nearly three decades have passed since Mr Cruel's last attack, retired Detective Chris O'Connor said the investigation remains active.]

[ espionage ] is hit in [An investigation by National Public Radio and PBS found that fear of losing profits has driven the silence from US companies who see rocking the boat as more of a threat to their livelihood than taking strong action.  The problem of China hacking US businesses and stealing intellectual property has been going on for decades. But when it comes to fighting the crime wave from China, the US government has been hampered by a lack of cooperation from the victims.  In dozens of interviews with U.S. government and business representatives, officials involved in commerce with China said hacking and theft were an open secret for almost two decades, allowed to quietly continue because U.S. companies had too much money at stake to make waves. Wendy Cutler, who was a veteran negotiator at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, says it wasn't just that U.S. businesses were hesitant to come forward in specific cases. She says businesses didn't want the trade office to take "any strong action." "We are not as effective if we don't have the U.S. business community supporting us," she says. "Looking back on it, in retrospect, I think we probably should have been more active and more responsive. We kind of lost the big picture of what was really happening." None of the dozens of companies or organizations that NPR reached out to that have been victims of theft or corporate espionage originating from China would go on the record. And for its part, the Chinese government officially denied to NPR and Frontline that it has been involved in such practices.  It's estimated that Chinese unfair business practices are costing American companies $57 billion a year. But the exposure of company secrets can mean an incalcuable loss.  But now the impact of that secrecy is coming to light, they say. Companies are facing hundreds of millions of dollars in future losses from the theft, and U.S. officials say they are years behind trying to tackle the problem. Michael Wessel, commissioner on the U.S. government's U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, says it wasn't supposed to be this way. U.S. officials had high hopes when China officially joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. "There was a honeymoon period in the first six or seven years, a desire to try [to] make things work," Wessel says. But, he says, starting around 2006, businesses began coming to him saying that China had stolen their designs or ideas or had pressured them into partnerships and taken their technology. Just like with Hickton, Wessel says, they wouldn't come forward publicly.  China is counting on this code of omerta by American businesses as they continue with business as usual. But you would think that eventually, China's stealing will become so prevelant, that US companies will be forced to cooperate for self preservation.]
[security] is hit in [An investigation by National Public Radio and PBS found that fear of losing profits has driven the silence from US companies who see rocking the boat as more of a threat to their livelihood than taking strong action.  The problem of China hacking US businesses and stealing intellectual property has been going on for decades. But when it comes to fighting the crime wave from China, the US government has been hampered by a lack of cooperation from the victims.  In dozens of interviews with U.S. government and business representatives, officials involved in commerce with China said hacking and theft were an open secret for almost two decades, allowed to quietly continue because U.S. companies had too much money at stake to make waves. Wendy Cutler, who was a veteran negotiator at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, says it wasn't just that U.S. businesses were hesitant to come forward in specific cases. She says businesses didn't want the trade office to take "any strong action." "We are not as effective if we don't have the U.S. business community supporting us," she says. "Looking back on it, in retrospect, I think we probably should have been more active and more responsive. We kind of lost the big picture of what was really happening." None of the dozens of companies or organizations that NPR reached out to that have been victims of theft or corporate espionage originating from China would go on the record. And for its part, the Chinese government officially denied to NPR and Frontline that it has been involved in such practices.  It's estimated that Chinese unfair business practices are costing American companies $57 billion a year. But the exposure of company secrets can mean an incalcuable loss.  But now the impact of that secrecy is coming to light, they say.

[ intelligence ] is hit in [In the United States and Europe, the debate in the artificial intelligence community has focused on the unconscious biases of those designing the technology. Recent tests showed facial recognition systems made by companies like I.B.M. and Amazon were less accurate at identifying the features of darker-skinned people.  China’s efforts raise starker issues. While facial recognition technology uses aspects like skin tone and face shapes to sort images in photos or videos, it must be told by humans to categorize people based on social definitions of race or ethnicity. Chinese police, with the help of the start-ups, have done that.  “It’s something that seems shocking coming from the U.S., where there is most likely racism built into our algorithmic decision making, but not in an overt way like this,” said Jennifer Lynch, surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “There’s not a system designed to identify someone as African-American, for example.”  The Chinese A.I. companies behind the software include Yitu, Megvii, SenseTime, and CloudWalk, which are each valued at more than $1 billion. Another company, Hikvision, that sells cameras and software to process the images, offered a minority recognition function, but began phasing it out in 2018, according to one of the people .  The companies’ valuations soared in 2018 as China’s Ministry of Public Security, its top police agency, set aside billions of dollars under two government plans, called Skynet and Sharp Eyes, to computerize surveillance, policing and intelligence collection.  In a statement, a SenseTime spokeswoman said she checked with “relevant teams,” who were not aware its technology was being used to profile. Megvii said in a statement it was focused on “commercial not political solutions,” adding, “we are concerned about the well-being and safety of individual citizens, not about monitoring groups.” CloudWalk and Yitu did not respond to requests for comment.  China’s Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request for comment.  Selling products with names like Fire Eye, Sky Eye and Dragonfly Eye , the start-ups promise to use A.I. to analyze footage from China’s surveillance cameras. The technology is not mature — in 2017 Yitu promoted a one-in-three success rate when the police responded to its alarms at a train station — and many of China’s cameras are not powerful enough for facial recognition software to work effectively.]

[ terrorist] is hit in [First let me make a comment about the persistent professional irresponsibility in form of derogatory journalism among the Western Media whenever covering African related news, before I explain the irrationality that has made the US court to unfairly dismiss the compensation lawsuit against Germany for genocide and property seizures committed during the last century in it mad colonial rampage executed on the People of Namibia.  The issue of derogatory journalism came on the surface immediately when the US Federal Court in New York made its ruling on 8th March 2019, the media all over the world went awash with this decision as a breaking news item. Most notable, were the big-time Media houses from the Western world, they chose to the item but in the language so demeaning, derogating and full of innuendos against the parties on the side of Africa, the parties that were using the court to enforce the justifiable rights of the families of the people of Namibia that historically suffered the massacres, mass killing, forced displacement and brutal violence perpetrated by the Germany colonial adventurists.  After getting repulsed with how the New York Times had maintained a sarcastic timbre in the many in which it reported this matter, I chose to sample, Deutsch Welle, Washington Post, the Reuters and the Daily Mail to find out how they had reported the matter, it was all disgusting, it all read like the sentences from the passages of racism in Conrad’s Heart of Darkness.  The Deutsche Welle was the leading in this kind of derogatory Journalism; it uses the word ‘tribe’ where it was supposed to use the word Nation of Namibia, it used the word ‘tribal plaintiff’ where it was supposed to use the word ‘plaintiff’, It uses the word ‘tribal lawyer’ when it was supposed to be the ‘prosecuting lawyer’. The Deutsche Welle also uses article ‘a’ in referring to the plaintiff side when it was supposed to be article ‘the’. I Mean it was a pageant of sarcastic journalism with very funny photos of emaciated and lugubrious black children in a company of miserable black women inserted in different parts of the body of the story. The story and the pictures are available online, my dear reader, you can visit the websites and confirm for yourself. The Western media must desist from such type of self-defeating journalism for the sake of respecting the dignity of global audience.  In regard to the matter, the local media quoted the German legal representative and negotiator with Namibia government, Ruprecht Polenz, to be insensitively commenting that failure of the case was predictable, given that the case was more of political and moral issue, but not a legal issue. This is only four years since the government of Germany refused to make official apology to the people of Namibia. Thus, it can as well be inferred that the New York federal judge Laura Taylor Swain dismissed this case without necessarily considering the evidence and the philosophy of Natural justice, but by only listening to Western politics of self-justification about Africa, which is usually influenced by racial consciousness but not objective consideration of facts.  The indubitable facts are that after 1860 every country in Europe had a ministry in charge of colonies. Germany as one of the major players in European imperialism had a well-established ministry in charge of colonial resources. In the early 1900s, Germany government through its ministry of colonial affairs ordered it overseas troops in Africa to kill those protesting its colonial entry into Namibia. It was General Lothar von Trotha that issued the order. The order was executed. Over one million un-armed people of Namibia were killed. Most of them were un-armed women and children. Research into this history by Assa Okoth, published as a high school text book of African History, reveals that the massacre affected all the communities of Namibia, however the Herero and Namaqua were the most affected.  After this massacre, the Germany colonial troops looted and plundered resources as well as effecting mass seizure of properties. The troops also took the skulls of their victims to Germany for sale to the government hospital as materials resources for medical research. The people of Germany have been so un-ashamed of such sale of the skulls to an extent that as recent as 2015 some bones and the skulls were evidently sold by the wife of a certain German anthropologist to the American Museum of Natural History.  It is somewhat unspeakable to learn that it is not only Germany that has refused to be Accountable and apologetic for the brutalities committed to Africa. Many other countries took advantages of Africa’s un-developed state of arms technology to brutalize the people of Africa. Joe Khamis in his latest book, the Wretched Africans (2019) reports that the countries of the middle East and Britain colluded to falsify data or statistics about the number of black people raided as slaves from Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia in last three centuries to be sold across the Indian ocean to Bombay and then other parts of the Arab world. So far there is no any country in the Arab world that has information about what happened to the lives of black slaves that were taken to their countries.  Joe Khamis in the same Wretched Africans reports that over 10 million black slaves were taken across the Indian ocean to Bombay (India) for resale to Europe and Arab countries. But as today there is no any surviving black family with the black-slave ancestry anywhere in the Arab world. The slaves that were not sold to Europe or Arab world were dumped in Bombay, then they were used by Indian merchants as domestic slaves, on the eventuality of worldwide abolition of slavery, the Indian community drove the black ex-slaves into the forest, until now these ex-slave black people live in the Bombay wild forest with animals as if they part of the wild nature, they are usually referred to sarcastically as the Bombay black men.  The media in India managed to keep this violated black community in the bush of darkness, it kept in secret for over a century, no one ever knew that there are black people living in the wild bush in India with no education, domestic homes and access to government services. It was until four years ago that the media in Kenya made some efforts to run a feature story about the Bombay Black families living in the Wild forest .it was taunting. Unfortunately, India and the Arab world have never apologized to Africa.  There are some other massacres committed by the British on the people of Kenya but history and the conventional opportunism in the bourgeoisie media chose to remain oblivious about them. Some of these massacres are the West Pokot Massacre committed in the year 1947 during which over five thousand peasant followers of Elijah Masinde’s Dini ya Msambwa were killed. Another infamous savage killing of Africans by the British but also held in oblivion is the Bukusu Massacre perpetrated by Charlese Hobley, Gunter Wagner and William Grant in 1904 in which over 10 thousand people were killed in Bungoma and Webuye.  When you venture to read A Good Muslim, a Bad Muslim, by Mahmood Mamdan, there are facts and evidences of modern massacres perpetrated as late as 1990’s through the terrorist-like American wars of proxies in Angola and Mozambique. But American politics of self-righteousness has never accepted to call them massacres, instead they were verbally ornamented by the American press as Low Intensity Conflicts (LIC), for no another reason but for selfish social-justification otherwise known as impunity. An impunity of military kind in such a juncture.  In a word, Europe and America are not willing to remember how they brutalized Africa. Europe is not ready to remember how it used black soldiers in the first and second world wars, without giving any decent burial to those that died in battle-field nor compensating or re-settling those that fought the wars to the end. America is not ready to remember how the sweat, blood and labour of black slaves was mercilessly consumed up in producing American economic greatness, only to leave the black American families to wallow in persistent poverty until now. Neither of them, America and Europe have apologized to Africa. Such a history of un-punished violation of the rights of a black person is the only force that made the Federal judge to gambol in decision with the Namibian case against Germany, but not facts of evidence. It is a judicial bungle of the century.]

But American politics of self-righteousness has never accepted to call them massacres, instead they were verbally ornamented by the American press as Low Intensity Conflicts (LIC), for no another reason but for selfish social-justification otherwise known as impunity. An impunity of military kind in such a juncture.  In a word, Europe and America are not willing to remember how they brutalized Africa. Europe is not ready to remember how it used black soldiers in the first and second world wars, without giving any decent burial to those that died in battle-field nor compensating or re-settling those that fought the wars to the end. America is not ready to remember how the sweat, blood and labour of black slaves was mercilessly consumed up in producing American economic greatness, only to leave the black American families to wallow in persistent poverty until now. Neither of them, America and Europe have apologized to Africa. Such a history of un-punished violation of the rights of a black person is the only force that made the Federal judge to gambol in decision with the Namibian case against Germany, but not facts of evidence. It is a judicial bungle of the century.]
[missing] is hit in [The Us Judge had no Reasons for Dismissing Namibian Genocide Case against Germany]
[evidence] is hit in [First let me make a comment about the persistent professional irresponsibility in form of derogatory journalism among the Western Media whenever covering African related news, before I explain the irrationality that has made the US court to unfairly dismiss the compensation lawsuit against Germany for genocide and property seizures committed during the last century in it mad colonial rampage executed on the People of Namibia.  The issue of derogatory journalism came on the surface immediately when the US Federal Court in New York made its ruling on 8th March 2019, the media all over the world went awash with this decision as a breaking news item. Most notable, were the big-time Media houses from the Western world, they chose to the item but in the language so demeaning, derogating and full of innuendos against the parties on the side of Africa, the parties that were using the court to enforce the justifiable rights of the families of the people of Namibia that historically suffered the massacres, mass killing, forced displacement and brutal violence perpetrated by the Germany colonial adventurists.  After getting repulsed with how the New York Times had maintained a sarcastic timbre in the many in which it reported this matter, I chose to sample, Deutsch Welle, Washington Post, the Reuters and the Daily Mail to find out how they had reported the matter, it was all disgusting, it all read like the sentences from the passages of racism in Conrad’s Heart of Darkness.  The Deutsche Welle was the leading in this kind of derogatory Journalism; it uses the word ‘tribe’ where it was supposed to use the word Nation of Namibia, it used the word ‘tribal plaintiff’ where it was supposed to use the word ‘plaintiff’, It uses the word ‘tribal lawyer’ when it was supposed to be the ‘prosecuting lawyer’. The Deutsche Welle also uses article ‘a’ in referring to the plaintiff side when it was supposed to be article ‘the’. I Mean it was a pageant of sarcastic journalism with very funny photos of emaciated and lugubrious black children in a company of miserable black women inserted in different parts of the body of the story. The story and the pictures are available online, my dear reader, you can visit the websites and confirm for yourself. The Western media must desist from such type of self-defeating journalism for the sake of respecting the dignity of global audience.  In regard to the matter, the local media quoted the German legal representative and negotiator with Namibia government, Ruprecht Polenz, to be insensitively commenting that failure of the case was predictable, given that the case was more of political and moral issue, but not a legal issue. This is only four years since the government of Germany refused to make official apology to the people of Namibia. Thus, it can as well be inferred that the New York federal judge Laura Taylor Swain dismissed this case without necessarily considering the evidence and the philosophy of Natural justice, but by only listening to Western politics of self-justification about Africa, which is usually influenced by racial consciousness but not objective consideration of facts.  The indubitable facts are that after 1860 every country in Europe had a ministry in charge of colonies. Germany as one of the major players in European imperialism had a well-established ministry in charge of colonial resources. In the early 1900s, Germany government through its ministry of colonial affairs ordered it overseas troops in Africa to kill those protesting its colonial entry into Namibia. It was General Lothar von Trotha that issued the order. The order was executed. Over one million un-armed people of Namibia were killed. Most of them were un-armed women and children. Research into this history by Assa Okoth, published as a high school text book of African History, reveals that the massacre affected all the communities of Namibia, however the Herero and Namaqua were the most affected.  After this massacre, the Germany colonial troops looted and plundered resources as well as effecting mass seizure of properties. The troops also took the skulls of their victims to Germany for sale to the government hospital as materials resources for medical research. The people of Germany have been so un-ashamed of such sale of the skulls to an extent that as recent as 2015 some bones and the skulls were evidently sold by the wife of a certain German anthropologist to the American Museum of Natural History.  It is somewhat unspeakable to learn that it is not only Germany that has refused to be Accountable and apologetic for the brutalities committed to Africa. Many other countries took advantages of Africa’s un-developed state of arms technology to brutalize the people of Africa. Joe Khamis in his latest book, the Wretched Africans (2019) reports that the countries of the middle East and Britain colluded to falsify data or statistics about the number of black people raided as slaves from Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia in last three centuries to be sold across the Indian ocean to Bombay and then other parts of the Arab world. So far there is no any country in the Arab world that has information about what happened to the lives of black slaves that were taken to their countries.  Joe Khamis in the same Wretched Africans reports that over 10 million black slaves were taken across the Indian ocean to Bombay (India) for resale to Europe and Arab countries. But as today there is no any surviving black family with the black-slave ancestry anywhere in the Arab world. The slaves that were not sold to Europe or Arab world were dumped in Bombay, then they were used by Indian merchants as domestic slaves, on the eventuality of worldwide abolition of slavery, the Indian community drove the black ex-slaves into the forest, until now these ex-slave black people live in the Bombay wild forest with animals as if they part of the wild nature, they are usually referred to sarcastically as the Bombay black men.  The media in India managed to keep this violated black community in the bush of darkness, it kept in secret for over a century, no one ever knew that there are black people living in the wild bush in India with no education, domestic homes and access to government services. It was until four years ago that the media in Kenya made some efforts to run a feature story about the Bombay Black families living in the Wild forest .it was taunting. Unfortunately, India and the Arab world have never apologized to Africa.  There are some other massacres committed by the British on the people of Kenya but history and the conventional opportunism in the bourgeoisie media chose to remain oblivious about them. Some of these massacres are the West Pokot Massacre committed in the year 1947 during which over five thousand peasant followers of Elijah Masinde’s Dini ya Msambwa were killed. Another infamous savage killing of Africans by the British but also held in oblivion is the Bukusu Massacre perpetrated by Charlese Hobley, Gunter Wagner and William Grant in 1904 in which over 10 thousand people were killed in Bungoma and Webuye.  When you venture to read A Good Muslim, a Bad Muslim, by Mahmood Mamdan, there are facts and evidences of modern massacres perpetrated as late as 1990’s through the terrorist-like American wars of proxies in Angola and Mozambique.

[ congress ] is hit in [Black Trunk From PM Modi's Chopper Unlocks Congress Conspiracy Theory]
[ congress ] is hit in [The Congress today alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's helicopter was seen transporting a "suspicious black trunk" during his visit to Karnataka's Chitradurga earlier this week, and demanded a thorough probe into the matter.  Party spokesperson Anand Sharma said the Election Commission must look into the contents of the trunk. "We saw that there were three more choppers escorting the Prime Minister's helicopter. After landing, a black trunk was taken out and whisked away in a private car that was not part of the special protection group carcade," he said, adding that the Congress' Karnataka unit has already filed a complaint with the Election Commission in this regard.  Mr Sharma alleged that the trunk may have contained money. "What was there in the trunk? If there was no cash in it, let an inquiry be held," he said.  The Prime Minister had addressed the election rally in Chitradurga on April 9. Soon after the rally, Congress workers posted the video on Twitter asking uncharitable questions. NDTV cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.  Mr Sharma then went on to ask PM Modi to give an account of his five-year rule to the people of the country as a tribute to reformist BR Ambedkar on his birth anniversary, and reiterated the allegations of corruption in the Modi government's Rafale fighter jet deal.  "The Prime Minister is trying to control and change the narrative because he has no courage to face real issues," he said. "Why is the Prime Minister silent on Rafale? Make the minutes of the meeting between Prime Minister and former French president Francois Hollande on the Rafale deal public by tomorrow. As there has been a controversy, it will help settle things once and for all."  The BJP trashed the opposition's allegations on the black trunk as well as the Rafale deal. "These are baseless allegations, and the Congress -- which is synonymous with corruption -- should come clean on its own issues," said party spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao.  The Congress has alleged irregularities in the Rafale deal, saying that the government was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over Rs 1,670 crore as against Rs 526 crore finalised by the UPA government when it was negotiating the deal.  Disclaimer: NDTV has been sued for 10,000 crores by Anil Ambani's Reliance Group for its coverage of the Rafale deal.

[ gas ] is hit in [Editorial Note: The following news reports are summaries from original sources. They may also include corrections of Arabic names and political terminology. Comments are in parentheses. Share the link of this article with your facebook friends While brutal force has been used to create Zionist Israel and sustain it thus far, Zionist claims to Palestine are false. Actually, from the five thousand years of known written history, there has been a continuous Palestinian-Canaanite presence in the Holy Land. Despite the Zionist false claims, the ancient Israelites ruled part of the land for only 85 years (during the reign of David, Solomon, and Solomon's son). After that, the Egyptians conquered Palestine-Canaan in 925 BC, followed by Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, before the Arab Muslim rule, starting from 636 AD. By the Time Jesus started his mission, the three population groups of Canaanites, Palestinians, and Israelites were melted together in religion and language. Most of them became Christians when Constantine converted in 313 AD. Then, most of them became Muslims in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. So, Palestinian Muslims, Christians, and Jews are the ones who have the right to claim descent from ancient Israelites, Palestinians, and Canaanites, not Zionists from other continents. The following news stories are just examples of the Israeli occupation government violations of Palestinian human rights, on daily basis. http://imemc.org/, https://paltoday.ps/ar/ More detailed news stories can be found at the following sources: https://english.palinfo.com/ Maisara Abu Shallouf, 15, was killed inside Gaza Strip by Israeli occupation soldiers from across the border, April 12, 2019 Palestinian Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face,   by Israeli occupation soldiers, in Hebron, April 14, 2019 Palestinian school children attacked by tear gas by Israeli occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 14, 2019 Palestinian protesters attacked by tear gas by Israeli   occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 12, 2019 A Palestinian man Saturday was shot in the face by Israeli occupation forces for unknown reasons, north of the city of Hebron in the southern West Bank, according to Maan News. Witnesses said that the victim, Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face, by Israeli police forces. The bullet was reported to have traveled completely through the young man’s face, as seen in the above photo. Medical sources described the injury as moderate, and said Abu Fanous was transferred to a local medical center for treatment. Nowhere is Israel’s use of excessive force against the civilian Palestinian population more clearly exhibited than in the Gaza Strip. Since March 2018, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, 203 Palestinians have been killed, and 12, 056 have been wounded, among those include women, children, medical personnel, and journalists. Israeli occupation soldiers attacked, on Friday evening, the weekly Great March Processions in the besieged Gaza Strip, killing one child, and injuring at 55 others, including one who suffered serious wounds, and two medics. The Palestinian Health Ministry has reported that the soldiers shot a child, identified as Maisara Mousa Ali Abu Shallouf, 15, after shooting him with live fire in the abdomen, east of Jabalia, in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. The soldiers also fired live rounds and gas bombs at medics trying to reach the child to provide him with the urgently needed medical help, before he succumbed to his wounds. Dr. Ashraf al-Qedra, the spokesperson of the Health Ministry In Gaza, said the soldiers shot 66 Palestinians, including 15 children and six women, in addition to two medics. It added that one of the wounded Palestinians suffered life-threatening wounds. The Health Ministry also stated that the soldiers shot two medics and caused others to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. The protests took place in five areas in the eastern parts of the Gaza Strip, from Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia, in the northern part, to Gaza city and central Gaza, in addition to Khan Younis and Rafah, in the southern part of the coastal region. Media sources in Gaza said the army used high-velocity gas bombs, and live fire, targeting many areas far away from the perimeter fence. They added that the soldiers also targeted several ambulances, medics and journalists, with sniper fire, in addition to the high-velocity gas bombs. The protests this week were also in support and solidarity with the Israeli occupation soldiers fired, Sunday, dozens of gas bombs into several schools, and surrounding areas in Hebron city, in the southern part of the occupied West Bank, causing dozens of schoolchildren and teachers, to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. Media sources said dozens of soldiers invaded the southern area of Hebron city, and fired a barrage of gas bombs into several schools, and their surrounding areas. Dozens of schoolchildren, and several teachers, suffered the effects of teargas inhalation and received the needed medical treatment. The Israeli army claimed several Palestinians hurled stones at the military vehicles, however, the schools and many homes in southern Hebron, especially around the Ibrahimi Mosque, are subject to constant violations not only by the soldiers, but also by the illegal Israeli colonists who frequently attack the residents, especially the students while heading to school or returning to their homes, in addition to the Palestinian homes and property. In related news, the soldiers abducted Sari and Yousef al-Akel, from Beit Ola town, while walking in Tal Romedia neighborhood in the center of Hebron city. Also on Sunday, the soldiers caused dozens of schoolchildren to suffer the severe effects of teargas inhalation in a school in Orif village, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus. Israeli occupation soldiers caused, Sunday, dozens of Palestinian schoolchildren to suffer the severe effects of teargas inhalation in a school in Orif village, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus. Media sources said the soldiers invaded the village, before storming the local high school, and fired a barrage of gas bombs at students protesting the invasion, causing dozens to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. Medics rushed to the school and provided the wounded students with the urgently needed medical attention, and moved many of them to a local medical center for further treatment. It is worth mentioning that the school has been a target of frequent attacks and violations by Israeli soldiers and illegal colonialist settlers and was shut down six times this current semester. The latest assault was carried out after illegal Israeli colonists from Yitzhar colony, which was built on Palestinian lands, attacked the village and several surrounding village, and damaged to cars in addition to causing fractures to one Palestinian. Israeli occupation soldiers abducted, on Sunday at dawn, at least fifteen Palestinians, including the governor of occupied East Jerusalem, after storming their homes and ransacking them, in several parts of the West Bank. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Society (PPS) has reported that the soldiers abducted Jerusalem governor, Adnan Gheith, who was previously repeatedly abducted, interrogated and imprisoned, in addition to four Palestinians, identified as Mohammad Samir Obeid, Bashar Mheisin, Tajuddin Maher Mheisin and Mohammad Omran Obeid. It is worth mentioning that, after abducting the governor several times since October of 2018, the Israeli army issued orders barring him from entering the West Bank for six months. In Tulkarem, in northern West Bank, the soldiers invaded and searched homes in Far’un town, south of the city, and abducted Islam Jihad ‘Adwan, Ezzeddin Mohammad Hamed, Wasim Samir Farkh, Shadi Tal’at Toheimer and Hamoud Mohammad Hamed. In Hebron, in southern West Bank, the soldiers also invaded and searched homes and abducted four Palestinians, identified as Amin Khalil as-Sous and Hayel Ishaq Rajoub, from Doura town, south of Hebron, in addition to Zeineddin Nafeth Jaradat and Hamada Hasan Jaradat, both fifteen years of age, from Sa’ir town, east of the city. Furthermore, the soldiers invaded Teqoua’ town, southeast of Bethlehem, and summoned Sami Ali Sabah, 24, for interrogation in Etzion military base, south of the city. Locals reported that Israeli naval boats opened fire at Palestinian fishing boats off the coast of the northern Gaza Strip. No injuries were reported, according to Ma’an. The Israeli army also regularly detains and opens fire on unarmed Palestinian fishermen, shepherds, and farmers along the border areas, if they approach the buffer zone, as authorities have not made clear the precise area of the designated zone. The practice has in effect destroyed much of the agricultural and fishing sector of the blockaded coastal enclave, which has been under an Israeli air, land, and sea blockade for 10 years.

According to observations by PCHR’s fieldworkers, the Israeli forces who stationed in prone positions and in military jeeps along the fence with Israel continued to use excessive force against the demonstrators by opening fire and firing tear gas canisters at them. As a result, dozens of the demonstrators were hit with bullets and teargas canisters without posing any imminent threat or danger to the life of soldiers. On Friday, 14 April 2019, the incidents were as follows: At approximately 16:00, thousands of civilians, including women, children and entire families, started swarming to the five encampments established by the Supreme National Authority of Great March of Return and Breaking the Siege adjacent to the border fence with Israel in eastern Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds, including children and women, approached the border fence with Israel in front of each encampment and gathered tens of meters away from the main border fence, attempting to throw stones at the Israeli forces and firing incendiary balloons along the border fence. Demonstrators chanted slogans, raised flags and, attempted to approach the border fence, set fire to tires and tried to throw stones at the Israeli forces. Although the demonstrators gathered in areas open to the Israeli snipers stationed on the top of the sand berms and military watchtowers and inside and behind the military jeeps, the Israeli forces fired live and rubber bullets in addition to a barrage of tear gas canisters. The Israeli shooting, which continued at around 19:00, resulted in the killing of Maysara Mousa Suliman Abu Shalouf (15), from ‘zbit Beit Hanoun. At approximately 17:00, Maysara sustained a live bullet wound that entered his left waist and settled in the pelvis while standing few meters away from the border fence in eastern Jabalia.

The number of those wounded only include those wounded with live bullets and directly hit with tear gas canisters, as there have been thousand others who suffered tear gas inhalation and sustained bruises. Notes PCHR reiterates Palestinians’ right to peaceful assembly to confront Israel and its forces’ denial of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination, right to return and right to end the occupation of the Palestinian territory. PCHR stresses that the Israeli forces should stop using excessive force and respond to the legitimate demands of the demonstrators, particularly lifting the closure which is the real solution to end the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. PCHR emphasizes that continuously targeting civilians, who exercise their right to peaceful assembly or while carrying out their humanitarian duty, is a serious violation of the rules of international law, international humanitarian law, the ICC Rome Statute and Fourth Geneva Convention. Thus, PCHR reiterates its call upon the ICC Prosecutor to open an official investigation in these crimes and to prosecute and hold accountable all those applying or involved in issuing orders within the Israeli Forces at the security and political echelons. PCHR also emphasizes that the High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention should fulfill their obligation under Article 1; i.e., to respect and ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances and their obligations under Article 146 to prosecute persons alleged to commit grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention. PCHR calls upon Switzerland, in its capacity as the Depository State for the Convention, to demand the High Contracting Parties to convene a meeting and ensure Israel’s respect for this Convention, noting that these grave breaches constitute war crimes under Article 147 of the same Convention and Protocol (I) Additional to the Geneva Conventions regarding the guarantee of Palestinian civilians’ right to protection in the occupied territories.

He stressed that the Israeli authorities clearly target Bir Una’s residents as the Israeli authorities demolished a house belonging to him beside demolishing another one a year ago. Moreover, a month ago, the Israeli authorities demolished a house and barracks belonging to Waleed’s cousins; Mohammed and Moussa Zarina. Waleed indicated that the Israeli policy against the area and the family made them sustain great economic losses.

[ attack ] is hit in [Editorial Note: The following news reports are summaries from original sources. They may also include corrections of Arabic names and political terminology. Comments are in parentheses. Share the link of this article with your facebook friends While brutal force has been used to create Zionist Israel and sustain it thus far, Zionist claims to Palestine are false. Actually, from the five thousand years of known written history, there has been a continuous Palestinian-Canaanite presence in the Holy Land. Despite the Zionist false claims, the ancient Israelites ruled part of the land for only 85 years (during the reign of David, Solomon, and Solomon's son). After that, the Egyptians conquered Palestine-Canaan in 925 BC, followed by Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, before the Arab Muslim rule, starting from 636 AD. By the Time Jesus started his mission, the three population groups of Canaanites, Palestinians, and Israelites were melted together in religion and language. Most of them became Christians when Constantine converted in 313 AD. Then, most of them became Muslims in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. So, Palestinian Muslims, Christians, and Jews are the ones who have the right to claim descent from ancient Israelites, Palestinians, and Canaanites, not Zionists from other continents. The following news stories are just examples of the Israeli occupation government violations of Palestinian human rights, on daily basis. http://imemc.org/, https://paltoday.ps/ar/ More detailed news stories can be found at the following sources: https://english.palinfo.com/ Maisara Abu Shallouf, 15, was killed inside Gaza Strip by Israeli occupation soldiers from across the border, April 12, 2019 Palestinian Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face,   by Israeli occupation soldiers, in Hebron, April 14, 2019 Palestinian school children attacked by tear gas by Israeli occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 14, 2019 Palestinian protesters attacked by tear gas by Israeli   occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 12, 2019 A Palestinian man Saturday was shot in the face by Israeli occupation forces for unknown reasons, north of the city of Hebron in the southern West Bank, according to Maan News.

The bullet was reported to have traveled completely through the young man’s face, as seen in the above photo.

Nowhere is Israel’s use of excessive force against the civilian Palestinian population more clearly exhibited than in the Gaza Strip. Since March 2018, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, 203 Palestinians have been killed, and 12, 056 have been wounded, among those include women, children, medical personnel, and journalists. Israeli occupation soldiers attacked, on Friday evening, the weekly Great March Processions in the besieged Gaza Strip, killing one child, and injuring at 55 others, including one who suffered serious wounds, and two medics. The Palestinian Health Ministry has reported that the soldiers shot a child, identified as Maisara Mousa Ali Abu Shallouf, 15, after shooting him with live fire in the abdomen, east of Jabalia, in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. The soldiers also fired live rounds and gas bombs at medics trying to reach the child to provide him with the urgently needed medical help, before he succumbed to his wounds.

The Palestinian Prisoners’ Society (PPS) has reported that the soldiers abducted Jerusalem governor, Adnan Gheith, who was previously repeatedly abducted, interrogated and imprisoned, in addition to four Palestinians, identified as Mohammad Samir Obeid, Bashar Mheisin, Tajuddin Maher Mheisin and Mohammad Omran Obeid. It is worth mentioning that, after abducting the governor several times since October of 2018, the Israeli army issued orders barring him from entering the West Bank for six months. In Tulkarem, in northern West Bank, the soldiers invaded and searched homes in Far’un town, south of the city, and abducted Islam Jihad ‘Adwan, Ezzeddin Mohammad Hamed, Wasim Samir Farkh, Shadi Tal’at Toheimer and Hamoud Mohammad Hamed.

Notes PCHR reiterates Palestinians’ right to peaceful assembly to confront Israel and its forces’ denial of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination, right to return and right to end the occupation of the Palestinian territory. PCHR stresses that the Israeli forces should stop using excessive force and respond to the legitimate demands of the demonstrators, particularly lifting the closure which is the real solution to end the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. PCHR emphasizes that continuously targeting civilians, who exercise their right to peaceful assembly or while carrying out their humanitarian duty, is a serious violation of the rules of international law, international humanitarian law, the ICC Rome Statute and Fourth Geneva Convention. Thus, PCHR reiterates its call upon the ICC Prosecutor to open an official investigation in these crimes and to prosecute and hold accountable all those applying or involved in issuing orders within the Israeli Forces at the security and political echelons. PCHR also emphasizes that the High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention should fulfill their obligation under Article 1; i.e., to respect and ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances and their obligations under Article 146 to prosecute persons alleged to commit grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention. PCHR calls upon Switzerland, in its capacity as the Depository State for the Convention, to demand the High Contracting Parties to convene a meeting and ensure Israel’s respect for this Convention, noting that these grave breaches constitute war crimes under Article 147 of the same Convention and Protocol (I) Additional to the Geneva Conventions regarding the guarantee of Palestinian civilians’ right to protection in the occupied territories.

Waleed added that the Israeli authorities threatened the family to demolish all their houses, which belong to Waleed’s brothers; Khaled and Raed. He stressed that the Israeli authorities clearly target Bir Una’s residents as the Israeli authorities demolished a house belonging to him beside demolishing another one a year ago. Moreover, a month ago, the Israeli authorities demolished a house and barracks belonging to Waleed’s cousins; Mohammed and Moussa Zarina. Waleed indicated that the Israeli policy against the area and the family made them sustain great economic losses.

In addition, the PCHR calls upon the international community to speed up the reconstruction process necessary because of the destruction inflicted by the Israeli offensive on Gaza. PCHR calls for a prompt intervention to compel the Israeli authorities to lift the closure that obstructs the freedom of movement of goods and 1.8 million civilians that experience unprecedented economic, social, political and cultural hardships due to collective punishment policies and retaliatory action against civilians.

[ assault ] is hit in [Editorial Note: The following news reports are summaries from original sources. They may also include corrections of Arabic names and political terminology. Comments are in parentheses. Share the link of this article with your facebook friends While brutal force has been used to create Zionist Israel and sustain it thus far, Zionist claims to Palestine are false. Actually, from the five thousand years of known written history, there has been a continuous Palestinian-Canaanite presence in the Holy Land. Despite the Zionist false claims, the ancient Israelites ruled part of the land for only 85 years (during the reign of David, Solomon, and Solomon's son). After that, the Egyptians conquered Palestine-Canaan in 925 BC, followed by Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, before the Arab Muslim rule, starting from 636 AD. By the Time Jesus started his mission, the three population groups of Canaanites, Palestinians, and Israelites were melted together in religion and language. Most of them became Christians when Constantine converted in 313 AD. Then, most of them became Muslims in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. So, Palestinian Muslims, Christians, and Jews are the ones who have the right to claim descent from ancient Israelites, Palestinians, and Canaanites, not Zionists from other continents. The following news stories are just examples of the Israeli occupation government violations of Palestinian human rights, on daily basis. http://imemc.org/, https://paltoday.ps/ar/ More detailed news stories can be found at the following sources: https://english.palinfo.com/ Maisara Abu Shallouf, 15, was killed inside Gaza Strip by Israeli occupation soldiers from across the border, April 12, 2019 Palestinian Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face,   by Israeli occupation soldiers, in Hebron, April 14, 2019 Palestinian school children attacked by tear gas by Israeli occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 14, 2019 Palestinian protesters attacked by tear gas by Israeli   occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 12, 2019 A Palestinian man Saturday was shot in the face by Israeli occupation forces for unknown reasons, north of the city of Hebron in the southern West Bank, according to Maan News. Witnesses said that the victim, Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face, by Israeli police forces. The bullet was reported to have traveled completely through the young man’s face, as seen in the above photo. Medical sources described the injury as moderate, and said Abu Fanous was transferred to a local medical center for treatment. Nowhere is Israel’s use of excessive force against the civilian Palestinian population more clearly exhibited than in the Gaza Strip. Since March 2018, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, 203 Palestinians have been killed, and 12, 056 have been wounded, among those include women, children, medical personnel, and journalists. Israeli occupation soldiers attacked, on Friday evening, the weekly Great March Processions in the besieged Gaza Strip, killing one child, and injuring at 55 others, including one who suffered serious wounds, and two medics. The Palestinian Health Ministry has reported that the soldiers shot a child, identified as Maisara Mousa Ali Abu Shallouf, 15, after shooting him with live fire in the abdomen, east of Jabalia, in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. The soldiers also fired live rounds and gas bombs at medics trying to reach the child to provide him with the urgently needed medical help, before he succumbed to his wounds. Dr. Ashraf al-Qedra, the spokesperson of the Health Ministry In Gaza, said the soldiers shot 66 Palestinians, including 15 children and six women, in addition to two medics. It added that one of the wounded Palestinians suffered life-threatening wounds. The Health Ministry also stated that the soldiers shot two medics and caused others to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. The protests took place in five areas in the eastern parts of the Gaza Strip, from Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia, in the northern part, to Gaza city and central Gaza, in addition to Khan Younis and Rafah, in the southern part of the coastal region. Media sources in Gaza said the army used high-velocity gas bombs, and live fire, targeting many areas far away from the perimeter fence. They added that the soldiers also targeted several ambulances, medics and journalists, with sniper fire, in addition to the high-velocity gas bombs. The protests this week were also in support and solidarity with the Israeli occupation soldiers fired, Sunday, dozens of gas bombs into several schools, and surrounding areas in Hebron city, in the southern part of the occupied West Bank, causing dozens of schoolchildren and teachers, to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. Media sources said dozens of soldiers invaded the southern area of Hebron city, and fired a barrage of gas bombs into several schools, and their surrounding areas. Dozens of schoolchildren, and several teachers, suffered the effects of teargas inhalation and received the needed medical treatment. The Israeli army claimed several Palestinians hurled stones at the military vehicles, however, the schools and many homes in southern Hebron, especially around the Ibrahimi Mosque, are subject to constant violations not only by the soldiers, but also by the illegal Israeli colonists who frequently attack the residents, especially the students while heading to school or returning to their homes, in addition to the Palestinian homes and property. In related news, the soldiers abducted Sari and Yousef al-Akel, from Beit Ola town, while walking in Tal Romedia neighborhood in the center of Hebron city.

Media sources said the soldiers invaded the village, before storming the local high school, and fired a barrage of gas bombs at students protesting the invasion, causing dozens to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. Medics rushed to the school and provided the wounded students with the urgently needed medical attention, and moved many of them to a local medical center for further treatment. It is worth mentioning that the school has been a target of frequent attacks and violations by Israeli soldiers and illegal colonialist settlers and was shut down six times this current semester. The latest assault was carried out after illegal Israeli colonists from Yitzhar colony, which was built on Palestinian lands, attacked the village and several surrounding village, and damaged to cars in addition to causing fractures to one Palestinian. Israeli occupation soldiers abducted, on Sunday at dawn, at least fifteen Palestinians, including the governor of occupied East Jerusalem, after storming their homes and ransacking them, in several parts of the West Bank. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Society (PPS) has reported that the soldiers abducted Jerusalem governor, Adnan Gheith, who was previously repeatedly abducted, interrogated and imprisoned, in addition to four Palestinians, identified as Mohammad Samir Obeid, Bashar Mheisin, Tajuddin Maher Mheisin and Mohammad Omran Obeid. It is worth mentioning that, after abducting the governor several times since October of 2018, the Israeli army issued orders barring him from entering the West Bank for six months. In Tulkarem, in northern West Bank, the soldiers invaded and searched homes in Far’un town, south of the city, and abducted Islam Jihad ‘Adwan, Ezzeddin Mohammad Hamed, Wasim Samir Farkh, Shadi Tal’at Toheimer and Hamoud Mohammad Hamed. In Hebron, in southern West Bank, the soldiers also invaded and searched homes and abducted four Palestinians, identified as Amin Khalil as-Sous and Hayel Ishaq Rajoub, from Doura town, south of Hebron, in addition to Zeineddin Nafeth Jaradat and Hamada Hasan Jaradat, both fifteen years of age, from Sa’ir town, east of the city.

Locals reported that Israeli naval boats opened fire at Palestinian fishing boats off the coast of the northern Gaza Strip. No injuries were reported, according to Ma’an. The Israeli army also regularly detains and opens fire on unarmed Palestinian fishermen, shepherds, and farmers along the border areas, if they approach the buffer zone, as authorities have not made clear the precise area of the designated zone. The practice has in effect destroyed much of the agricultural and fishing sector of the blockaded coastal enclave, which has been under an Israeli air, land, and sea blockade for 10 years.

Medical sources said the soldiers shot a young man with a rubber-coated steel bullet in his leg, and caused dozens of Palestinians to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. The Palestinians hold processions in Kufur Qaddoum every Friday and Saturday, for the eighth consecutive year, demanding the army to reopen the town’s main road, which was blockaded fifteen years ago, to enable easy access for illegal colonialist settlers driving to and from the Kedumim Israeli colony, built on private Palestinian lands. Furthermore, the soldiers injured many Palestinians in Bab az-Zawiya area, in the center of Hebron city, in the southern part of the occupied West Bank. In related news, the soldiers attacked the weekly nonviolent procession against the illegal Annexation Wall and Colonies in Bil’in village, west of the central West Bank city of Ramallah, causing many protesters to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation.

According to observations by PCHR’s fieldworkers, the Israeli forces who stationed in prone positions and in military jeeps along the fence with Israel continued to use excessive force against the demonstrators by opening fire and firing tear gas canisters at them. As a result, dozens of the demonstrators were hit with bullets and teargas canisters without posing any imminent threat or danger to the life of soldiers. On Friday, 14 April 2019, the incidents were as follows: At approximately 16:00, thousands of civilians, including women, children and entire families, started swarming to the five encampments established by the Supreme National Authority of Great March of Return and Breaking the Siege adjacent to the border fence with Israel in eastern Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds, including children and women, approached the border fence with Israel in front of each encampment and gathered tens of meters away from the main border fence, attempting to throw stones at the Israeli forces and firing incendiary balloons along the border fence. Demonstrators chanted slogans, raised flags and, attempted to approach the border fence, set fire to tires and tried to throw stones at the Israeli forces. Although the demonstrators gathered in areas open to the Israeli snipers stationed on the top of the sand berms and military watchtowers and inside and behind the military jeeps, the Israeli forces fired live and rubber bullets in addition to a barrage of tear gas canisters. The Israeli shooting, which continued at around 19:00, resulted in the killing of Maysara Mousa Suliman Abu Shalouf (15), from ‘zbit Beit Hanoun.

Notes PCHR reiterates Palestinians’ right to peaceful assembly to confront Israel and its forces’ denial of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination, right to return and right to end the occupation of the Palestinian territory. PCHR stresses that the Israeli forces should stop using excessive force and respond to the legitimate demands of the demonstrators, particularly lifting the closure which is the real solution to end the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. PCHR emphasizes that continuously targeting civilians, who exercise their right to peaceful assembly or while carrying out their humanitarian duty, is a serious violation of the rules of international law, international humanitarian law, the ICC Rome Statute and Fourth Geneva Convention. Thus, PCHR reiterates its call upon the ICC Prosecutor to open an official investigation in these crimes and to prosecute and hold accountable all those applying or involved in issuing orders within the Israeli Forces at the security and political echelons. PCHR also emphasizes that the High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention should fulfill their obligation under Article 1; i.e., to respect and ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances and their obligations under Article 146 to prosecute persons alleged to commit grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention. PCHR calls upon Switzerland, in its capacity as the Depository State for the Convention, to demand the High Contracting Parties to convene a meeting and ensure Israel’s respect for this Convention, noting that these grave breaches constitute war crimes under Article 147 of the same Convention and Protocol (I) Additional to the Geneva Conventions regarding the guarantee of Palestinian civilians’ right to protection in the occupied territories.

[security] is hit in [Editorial Note: The following news reports are summaries from original sources. They may also include corrections of Arabic names and political terminology. Comments are in parentheses. Share the link of this article with your facebook friends While brutal force has been used to create Zionist Israel and sustain it thus far, Zionist claims to Palestine are false. Actually, from the five thousand years of known written history, there has been a continuous Palestinian-Canaanite presence in the Holy Land. Despite the Zionist false claims, the ancient Israelites ruled part of the land for only 85 years (during the reign of David, Solomon, and Solomon's son). After that, the Egyptians conquered Palestine-Canaan in 925 BC, followed by Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, before the Arab Muslim rule, starting from 636 AD. By the Time Jesus started his mission, the three population groups of Canaanites, Palestinians, and Israelites were melted together in religion and language. Most of them became Christians when Constantine converted in 313 AD. Then, most of them became Muslims in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. So, Palestinian Muslims, Christians, and Jews are the ones who have the right to claim descent from ancient Israelites, Palestinians, and Canaanites, not Zionists from other continents. The following news stories are just examples of the Israeli occupation government violations of Palestinian human rights, on daily basis. http://imemc.org/, https://paltoday.ps/ar/ More detailed news stories can be found at the following sources: https://english.palinfo.com/ Maisara Abu Shallouf, 15, was killed inside Gaza Strip by Israeli occupation soldiers from across the border, April 12, 2019 Palestinian Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face,   by Israeli occupation soldiers, in Hebron, April 14, 2019 Palestinian school children attacked by tear gas by Israeli occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 14, 2019 Palestinian protesters attacked by tear gas by Israeli   occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 12, 2019 A Palestinian man Saturday was shot in the face by Israeli occupation forces for unknown reasons, north of the city of Hebron in the southern West Bank, according to Maan News.

The bullet was reported to have traveled completely through the young man’s face, as seen in the above photo. Medical sources described the injury as moderate, and said Abu Fanous was transferred to a local medical center for treatment. Nowhere is Israel’s use of excessive force against the civilian Palestinian population more clearly exhibited than in the Gaza Strip. Since March 2018, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, 203 Palestinians have been killed, and 12, 056 have been wounded, among those include women, children, medical personnel, and journalists. Israeli occupation soldiers attacked, on Friday evening, the weekly Great March Processions in the besieged Gaza Strip, killing one child, and injuring at 55 others, including one who suffered serious wounds, and two medics.

Media sources in Gaza said the army used high-velocity gas bombs, and live fire, targeting many areas far away from the perimeter fence. They added that the soldiers also targeted several ambulances, medics and journalists, with sniper fire, in addition to the high-velocity gas bombs. The protests this week were also in support and solidarity with the Israeli occupation soldiers fired, Sunday, dozens of gas bombs into several schools, and surrounding areas in Hebron city, in the southern part of the occupied West Bank, causing dozens of schoolchildren and teachers, to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. Media sources said dozens of soldiers invaded the southern area of Hebron city, and fired a barrage of gas bombs into several schools, and their surrounding areas. Dozens of schoolchildren, and several teachers, suffered the effects of teargas inhalation and received the needed medical treatment. The Israeli army claimed several Palestinians hurled stones at the military vehicles, however, the schools and many homes in southern Hebron, especially around the Ibrahimi Mosque, are subject to constant violations not only by the soldiers, but also by the illegal Israeli colonists who frequently attack the residents, especially the students while heading to school or returning to their homes, in addition to the Palestinian homes and property.

Israeli occupation soldiers abducted, on Sunday at dawn, at least fifteen Palestinians, including the governor of occupied East Jerusalem, after storming their homes and ransacking them, in several parts of the West Bank. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Society (PPS) has reported that the soldiers abducted Jerusalem governor, Adnan Gheith, who was previously repeatedly abducted, interrogated and imprisoned, in addition to four Palestinians, identified as Mohammad Samir Obeid, Bashar Mheisin, Tajuddin Maher Mheisin and Mohammad Omran Obeid. It is worth mentioning that, after abducting the governor several times since October of 2018, the Israeli army issued orders barring him from entering the West Bank for six months. In Tulkarem, in northern West Bank, the soldiers invaded and searched homes in Far’un town, south of the city, and abducted Islam Jihad ‘Adwan, Ezzeddin Mohammad Hamed, Wasim Samir Farkh, Shadi Tal’at Toheimer and Hamoud Mohammad Hamed.

The Israeli army also regularly detains and opens fire on unarmed Palestinian fishermen, shepherds, and farmers along the border areas, if they approach the buffer zone, as authorities have not made clear the precise area of the designated zone. The practice has in effect destroyed much of the agricultural and fishing sector of the blockaded coastal enclave, which has been under an Israeli air, land, and sea blockade for 10 years.

As a result, dozens of the demonstrators were hit with bullets and teargas canisters without posing any imminent threat or danger to the life of soldiers. On Friday, 14 April 2019, the incidents were as follows: At approximately 16:00, thousands of civilians, including women, children and entire families, started swarming to the five encampments established by the Supreme National Authority of Great March of Return and Breaking the Siege adjacent to the border fence with Israel in eastern Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds, including children and women, approached the border fence with Israel in front of each encampment and gathered tens of meters away from the main border fence, attempting to throw stones at the Israeli forces and firing incendiary balloons along the border fence. Demonstrators chanted slogans, raised flags and, attempted to approach the border fence, set fire to tires and tried to throw stones at the Israeli forces. Although the demonstrators gathered in areas open to the Israeli snipers stationed on the top of the sand berms and military watchtowers and inside and behind the military jeeps, the Israeli forces fired live and rubber bullets in addition to a barrage of tear gas canisters. The Israeli shooting, which continued at around 19:00, resulted in the killing of Maysara Mousa Suliman Abu Shalouf (15), from ‘zbit Beit Hanoun.

The number of those wounded only include those wounded with live bullets and directly hit with tear gas canisters, as there have been thousand others who suffered tear gas inhalation and sustained bruises. Notes PCHR reiterates Palestinians’ right to peaceful assembly to confront Israel and its forces’ denial of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination, right to return and right to end the occupation of the Palestinian territory. PCHR stresses that the Israeli forces should stop using excessive force and respond to the legitimate demands of the demonstrators, particularly lifting the closure which is the real solution to end the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. PCHR emphasizes that continuously targeting civilians, who exercise their right to peaceful assembly or while carrying out their humanitarian duty, is a serious violation of the rules of international law, international humanitarian law, the ICC Rome Statute and Fourth Geneva Convention. Thus, PCHR reiterates its call upon the ICC Prosecutor to open an official investigation in these crimes and to prosecute and hold accountable all those applying or involved in issuing orders within the Israeli Forces at the security and political echelons. PCHR also emphasizes that the High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention should fulfill their obligation under Article 1; i.e., to respect and ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances and their obligations under Article 146 to prosecute persons alleged to commit grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention. PCHR calls upon Switzerland, in its capacity as the Depository State for the Convention, to demand the High Contracting Parties to convene a meeting and ensure Israel’s respect for this Convention, noting that these grave breaches constitute war crimes under Article 147 of the same Convention and Protocol (I) Additional to the Geneva Conventions regarding the guarantee of Palestinian civilians’ right to protection in the occupied territories.

He added that the Israeli court detained his nephew after he refused to sign the demolition order so his family had to pay NIS 230,000 to release him and implement the decision of self-demolition before 10 April 2019. Waleed indicated that the family hired an Israeli lawyer a year ago after the Israeli authorities’ threat to demolish the house. Large amounts of money were paid to the lawyers, but the court decided to demolish the house. Waleed added that the Israeli authorities threatened the family to demolish all their houses, which belong to Waleed’s brothers; Khaled and Raed. He stressed that the Israeli authorities clearly target Bir Una’s residents as the Israeli authorities demolished a house belonging to him beside demolishing another one a year ago. Moreover, a month ago, the Israeli authorities demolished a house and barracks belonging to Waleed’s cousins; Mohammed and Moussa Zarina. Waleed indicated that the Israeli policy against the area and the family made them sustain great economic losses.

In addition, the PCHR calls upon the international community to speed up the reconstruction process necessary because of the destruction inflicted by the Israeli offensive on Gaza. PCHR calls for a prompt intervention to compel the Israeli authorities to lift the closure that obstructs the freedom of movement of goods and 1.8 million civilians that experience unprecedented economic, social, political and cultural hardships due to collective punishment policies and retaliatory action against civilians.

[detain] is hit in [Editorial Note: The following news reports are summaries from original sources. They may also include corrections of Arabic names and political terminology. Comments are in parentheses. Share the link of this article with your facebook friends While brutal force has been used to create Zionist Israel and sustain it thus far, Zionist claims to Palestine are false. Actually, from the five thousand years of known written history, there has been a continuous Palestinian-Canaanite presence in the Holy Land. Despite the Zionist false claims, the ancient Israelites ruled part of the land for only 85 years (during the reign of David, Solomon, and Solomon's son). After that, the Egyptians conquered Palestine-Canaan in 925 BC, followed by Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, before the Arab Muslim rule, starting from 636 AD. By the Time Jesus started his mission, the three population groups of Canaanites, Palestinians, and Israelites were melted together in religion and language. Most of them became Christians when Constantine converted in 313 AD. Then, most of them became Muslims in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. So, Palestinian Muslims, Christians, and Jews are the ones who have the right to claim descent from ancient Israelites, Palestinians, and Canaanites, not Zionists from other continents. The following news stories are just examples of the Israeli occupation government violations of Palestinian human rights, on daily basis. http://imemc.org/, https://paltoday.ps/ar/ More detailed news stories can be found at the following sources: https://english.palinfo.com/ Maisara Abu Shallouf, 15, was killed inside Gaza Strip by Israeli occupation soldiers from across the border, April 12, 2019 Palestinian Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face,   by Israeli occupation soldiers, in Hebron, April 14, 2019 Palestinian school children attacked by tear gas by Israeli occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 14, 2019 Palestinian protesters attacked by tear gas by Israeli   occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 12, 2019 A Palestinian man Saturday was shot in the face by Israeli occupation forces for unknown reasons, north of the city of Hebron in the southern West Bank, according to Maan News. Witnesses said that the victim, Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face, by Israeli police forces. The bullet was reported to have traveled completely through the young man’s face, as seen in the above photo. Medical sources described the injury as moderate, and said Abu Fanous was transferred to a local medical center for treatment. Nowhere is Israel’s use of excessive force against the civilian Palestinian population more clearly exhibited than in the Gaza Strip. Since March 2018, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, 203 Palestinians have been killed, and 12, 056 have been wounded, among those include women, children, medical personnel, and journalists. Israeli occupation soldiers attacked, on Friday evening, the weekly Great March Processions in the besieged Gaza Strip, killing one child, and injuring at 55 others, including one who suffered serious wounds, and two medics. The Palestinian Health Ministry has reported that the soldiers shot a child, identified as Maisara Mousa Ali Abu Shallouf, 15, after shooting him with live fire in the abdomen, east of Jabalia, in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. The soldiers also fired live rounds and gas bombs at medics trying to reach the child to provide him with the urgently needed medical help, before he succumbed to his wounds.

The protests took place in five areas in the eastern parts of the Gaza Strip, from Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia, in the northern part, to Gaza city and central Gaza, in addition to Khan Younis and Rafah, in the southern part of the coastal region. Media sources in Gaza said the army used high-velocity gas bombs, and live fire, targeting many areas far away from the perimeter fence. They added that the soldiers also targeted several ambulances, medics and journalists, with sniper fire, in addition to the high-velocity gas bombs. The protests this week were also in support and solidarity with the Israeli occupation soldiers fired, Sunday, dozens of gas bombs into several schools, and surrounding areas in Hebron city, in the southern part of the occupied West Bank, causing dozens of schoolchildren and teachers, to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. Media sources said dozens of soldiers invaded the southern area of Hebron city, and fired a barrage of gas bombs into several schools, and their surrounding areas. Dozens of schoolchildren, and several teachers, suffered the effects of teargas inhalation and received the needed medical treatment. The Israeli army claimed several Palestinians hurled stones at the military vehicles, however, the schools and many homes in southern Hebron, especially around the Ibrahimi Mosque, are subject to constant violations not only by the soldiers, but also by the illegal Israeli colonists who frequently attack the residents, especially the students while heading to school or returning to their homes, in addition to the Palestinian homes and property. In related news, the soldiers abducted Sari and Yousef al-Akel, from Beit Ola town, while walking in Tal Romedia neighborhood in the center of Hebron city.

Media sources said the soldiers invaded the village, before storming the local high school, and fired a barrage of gas bombs at students protesting the invasion, causing dozens to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. Medics rushed to the school and provided the wounded students with the urgently needed medical attention, and moved many of them to a local medical center for further treatment. It is worth mentioning that the school has been a target of frequent attacks and violations by Israeli soldiers and illegal colonialist settlers and was shut down six times this current semester. The latest assault was carried out after illegal Israeli colonists from Yitzhar colony, which was built on Palestinian lands, attacked the village and several surrounding village, and damaged to cars in addition to causing fractures to one Palestinian. Israeli occupation soldiers abducted, on Sunday at dawn, at least fifteen Palestinians, including the governor of occupied East Jerusalem, after storming their homes and ransacking them, in several parts of the West Bank. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Society (PPS) has reported that the soldiers abducted Jerusalem governor, Adnan Gheith, who was previously repeatedly abducted, interrogated and imprisoned, in addition to four Palestinians, identified as Mohammad Samir Obeid, Bashar Mheisin, Tajuddin Maher Mheisin and Mohammad Omran Obeid. It is worth mentioning that, after abducting the governor several times since October of 2018, the Israeli army issued orders barring him from entering the West Bank for six months. In Tulkarem, in northern West Bank, the soldiers invaded and searched homes in Far’un town, south of the city, and abducted Islam Jihad ‘Adwan, Ezzeddin Mohammad Hamed, Wasim Samir Farkh, Shadi Tal’at Toheimer and Hamoud Mohammad Hamed.

The Israeli army also regularly detains and opens fire on unarmed Palestinian fishermen, shepherds, and farmers along the border areas, if they approach the buffer zone, as authorities have not made clear the precise area of the designated zone. The practice has in effect destroyed much of the agricultural and fishing sector of the blockaded coastal enclave, which has been under an Israeli air, land, and sea blockade for 10 years.

The Palestinians hold processions in Kufur Qaddoum every Friday and Saturday, for the eighth consecutive year, demanding the army to reopen the town’s main road, which was blockaded fifteen years ago, to enable easy access for illegal colonialist settlers driving to and from the Kedumim Israeli colony, built on private Palestinian lands. Furthermore, the soldiers injured many Palestinians in Bab az-Zawiya area, in the center of Hebron city, in the southern part of the occupied West Bank.

On 54th Friday of Great March of Return and Breaking Siege, Israeli Forces Kill Palestinian Child and Wound 93 Civilians, including 17 Children, 4 Women, 3 Paramedics, and Journalist The Palestinian Center For Human Rights: Ref: 58/2019 Date: 12 April 2019: Time: 18:00 GMT: On Friday evening, 12 April 2019, in excessive use of force against peaceful protesters on the 54th Friday of the March of Return and Breaking the Siege, Israeli forces killed a Palestinian child and wounded 93 civilians, including 17 children, four women, three paramedics, and a journalist, in eastern Gaza Strip. According to observations by PCHR’s fieldworkers, the Israeli forces who stationed in prone positions and in military jeeps along the fence with Israel continued to use excessive force against the demonstrators by opening fire and firing tear gas canisters at them. As a result, dozens of the demonstrators were hit with bullets and teargas canisters without posing any imminent threat or danger to the life of soldiers. On Friday, 14 April 2019, the incidents were as follows: At approximately 16:00, thousands of civilians, including women, children and entire families, started swarming to the five encampments established by the Supreme National Authority of Great March of Return and Breaking the Siege adjacent to the border fence with Israel in eastern Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds, including children and women, approached the border fence with Israel in front of each encampment and gathered tens of meters away from the main border fence, attempting to throw stones at the Israeli forces and firing incendiary balloons along the border fence. Demonstrators chanted slogans, raised flags and, attempted to approach the border fence, set fire to tires and tried to throw stones at the Israeli forces. Although the demonstrators gathered in areas open to the Israeli snipers stationed on the top of the sand berms and military watchtowers and inside and behind the military jeeps, the Israeli forces fired live and rubber bullets in addition to a barrage of tear gas canisters. The Israeli shooting, which continued at around 19:00, resulted in the killing of Maysara Mousa Suliman Abu Shalouf (15), from ‘zbit Beit Hanoun. At approximately 17:00, Maysara sustained a live bullet wound that entered his left waist and settled in the pelvis while standing few meters away from the border fence in eastern Jabalia.

The number of those wounded only include those wounded with live bullets and directly hit with tear gas canisters, as there have been thousand others who suffered tear gas inhalation and sustained bruises. Notes PCHR reiterates Palestinians’ right to peaceful assembly to confront Israel and its forces’ denial of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination, right to return and right to end the occupation of the Palestinian territory. PCHR stresses that the Israeli forces should stop using excessive force and respond to the legitimate demands of the demonstrators, particularly lifting the closure which is the real solution to end the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. PCHR emphasizes that continuously targeting civilians, who exercise their right to peaceful assembly or while carrying out their humanitarian duty, is a serious violation of the rules of international law, international humanitarian law, the ICC Rome Statute and Fourth Geneva Convention. Thus, PCHR reiterates its call upon the ICC Prosecutor to open an official investigation in these crimes and to prosecute and hold accountable all those applying or involved in issuing orders within the Israeli Forces at the security and political echelons. PCHR also emphasizes that the High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention should fulfill their obligation under Article 1; i.e., to respect and ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances and their obligations under Article 146 to prosecute persons alleged to commit grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention. PCHR calls upon Switzerland, in its capacity as the Depository State for the Convention, to demand the High Contracting Parties to convene a meeting and ensure Israel’s respect for this Convention, noting that these grave breaches constitute war crimes under Article 147 of the same Convention and Protocol (I) Additional to the Geneva Conventions regarding the guarantee of Palestinian civilians’ right to protection in the occupied territories.

[investigat] is hit in [Editorial Note: The following news reports are summaries from original sources. They may also include corrections of Arabic names and political terminology. Comments are in parentheses. Share the link of this article with your facebook friends While brutal force has been used to create Zionist Israel and sustain it thus far, Zionist claims to Palestine are false. Actually, from the five thousand years of known written history, there has been a continuous Palestinian-Canaanite presence in the Holy Land. Despite the Zionist false claims, the ancient Israelites ruled part of the land for only 85 years (during the reign of David, Solomon, and Solomon's son). After that, the Egyptians conquered Palestine-Canaan in 925 BC, followed by Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, before the Arab Muslim rule, starting from 636 AD. By the Time Jesus started his mission, the three population groups of Canaanites, Palestinians, and Israelites were melted together in religion and language. Most of them became Christians when Constantine converted in 313 AD. Then, most of them became Muslims in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. So, Palestinian Muslims, Christians, and Jews are the ones who have the right to claim descent from ancient Israelites, Palestinians, and Canaanites, not Zionists from other continents. The following news stories are just examples of the Israeli occupation government violations of Palestinian human rights, on daily basis. http://imemc.org/, https://paltoday.ps/ar/ More detailed news stories can be found at the following sources: https://english.palinfo.com/ Maisara Abu Shallouf, 15, was killed inside Gaza Strip by Israeli occupation soldiers from across the border, April 12, 2019 Palestinian Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face,   by Israeli occupation soldiers, in Hebron, April 14, 2019 Palestinian school children attacked by tear gas by Israeli occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 14, 2019 Palestinian protesters attacked by tear gas by Israeli   occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 12, 2019 A Palestinian man Saturday was shot in the face by Israeli occupation forces for unknown reasons, north of the city of Hebron in the southern West Bank, according to Maan News. Witnesses said that the victim, Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face, by Israeli police forces. The bullet was reported to have traveled completely through the young man’s face, as seen in the above photo. Medical sources described the injury as moderate, and said Abu Fanous was transferred to a local medical center for treatment. Nowhere is Israel’s use of excessive force against the civilian Palestinian population more clearly exhibited than in the Gaza Strip. Since March 2018, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, 203 Palestinians have been killed, and 12, 056 have been wounded, among those include women, children, medical personnel, and journalists. Israeli occupation soldiers attacked, on Friday evening, the weekly Great March Processions in the besieged Gaza Strip, killing one child, and injuring at 55 others, including one who suffered serious wounds, and two medics. The Palestinian Health Ministry has reported that the soldiers shot a child, identified as Maisara Mousa Ali Abu Shallouf, 15, after shooting him with live fire in the abdomen, east of Jabalia, in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. The soldiers also fired live rounds and gas bombs at medics trying to reach the child to provide him with the urgently needed medical help, before he succumbed to his wounds. Dr. Ashraf al-Qedra, the spokesperson of the Health Ministry In Gaza, said the soldiers shot 66 Palestinians, including 15 children and six women, in addition to two medics. It added that one of the wounded Palestinians suffered life-threatening wounds. The Health Ministry also stated that the soldiers shot two medics and caused others to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. The protests took place in five areas in the eastern parts of the Gaza Strip, from Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia, in the northern part, to Gaza city and central Gaza, in addition to Khan Younis and Rafah, in the southern part of the coastal region. Media sources in Gaza said the army used high-velocity gas bombs, and live fire, targeting many areas far away from the perimeter fence. They added that the soldiers also targeted several ambulances, medics and journalists, with sniper fire, in addition to the high-velocity gas bombs. The protests this week were also in support and solidarity with the Israeli occupation soldiers fired, Sunday, dozens of gas bombs into several schools, and surrounding areas in Hebron city, in the southern part of the occupied West Bank, causing dozens of schoolchildren and teachers, to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. Media sources said dozens of soldiers invaded the southern area of Hebron city, and fired a barrage of gas bombs into several schools, and their surrounding areas. Dozens of schoolchildren, and several teachers, suffered the effects of teargas inhalation and received the needed medical treatment. The Israeli army claimed several Palestinians hurled stones at the military vehicles, however, the schools and many homes in southern Hebron, especially around the Ibrahimi Mosque, are subject to constant violations not only by the soldiers, but also by the illegal Israeli colonists who frequently attack the residents, especially the students while heading to school or returning to their homes, in addition to the Palestinian homes and property. In related news, the soldiers abducted Sari and Yousef al-Akel, from Beit Ola town, while walking in Tal Romedia neighborhood in the center of Hebron city. Also on Sunday, the soldiers caused dozens of schoolchildren to suffer the severe effects of teargas inhalation in a school in Orif village, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus. Israeli occupation soldiers caused, Sunday, dozens of Palestinian schoolchildren to suffer the severe effects of teargas inhalation in a school in Orif village, south of the northern West Bank city of Nablus. Media sources said the soldiers invaded the village, before storming the local high school, and fired a barrage of gas bombs at students protesting the invasion, causing dozens to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. Medics rushed to the school and provided the wounded students with the urgently needed medical attention, and moved many of them to a local medical center for further treatment. It is worth mentioning that the school has been a target of frequent attacks and violations by Israeli soldiers and illegal colonialist settlers and was shut down six times this current semester. The latest assault was carried out after illegal Israeli colonists from Yitzhar colony, which was built on Palestinian lands, attacked the village and several surrounding village, and damaged to cars in addition to causing fractures to one Palestinian. Israeli occupation soldiers abducted, on Sunday at dawn, at least fifteen Palestinians, including the governor of occupied East Jerusalem, after storming their homes and ransacking them, in several parts of the West Bank. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Society (PPS) has reported that the soldiers abducted Jerusalem governor, Adnan Gheith, who was previously repeatedly abducted, interrogated and imprisoned, in addition to four Palestinians, identified as Mohammad Samir Obeid, Bashar Mheisin, Tajuddin Maher Mheisin and Mohammad Omran Obeid. It is worth mentioning that, after abducting the governor several times since October of 2018, the Israeli army issued orders barring him from entering the West Bank for six months. In Tulkarem, in northern West Bank, the soldiers invaded and searched homes in Far’un town, south of the city, and abducted Islam Jihad ‘Adwan, Ezzeddin Mohammad Hamed, Wasim Samir Farkh, Shadi Tal’at Toheimer and Hamoud Mohammad Hamed. In Hebron, in southern West Bank, the soldiers also invaded and searched homes and abducted four Palestinians, identified as Amin Khalil as-Sous and Hayel Ishaq Rajoub, from Doura town, south of Hebron, in addition to Zeineddin Nafeth Jaradat and Hamada Hasan Jaradat, both fifteen years of age, from Sa’ir town, east of the city. Furthermore, the soldiers invaded Teqoua’ town, southeast of Bethlehem, and summoned Sami Ali Sabah, 24, for interrogation in Etzion military base, south of the city. Locals reported that Israeli naval boats opened fire at Palestinian fishing boats off the coast of the northern Gaza Strip. No injuries were reported, according to Ma’an. The Israeli army also regularly detains and opens fire on unarmed Palestinian fishermen, shepherds, and farmers along the border areas, if they approach the buffer zone, as authorities have not made clear the precise area of the designated zone. The practice has in effect destroyed much of the agricultural and fishing sector of the blockaded coastal enclave, which has been under an Israeli air, land, and sea blockade for 10 years. Israeli occupation soldiers injured, Friday, many Palestinians in Bab az-Zawiya area, in the center of Hebron city, in the southern part of the occupied West Bank. Media sources said the soldiers attacked dozens of Palestinian protesters by firing a barrage of gas bombs and concussion grenades at them. They added that the soldiers shot a young man with a rubber-coated steel bullet, and caused dozens to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. Palestinian photojournalist, Mos’ab Shawar, said the soldiers attacked and clubbed him, in addition to shouting insults at his colleague Mousa al-Qawasmi. In related news, the soldiers attacked the weekly nonviolent procession against the illegal Annexation Wall and Colonies in Bil’in village, west of the central West Bank city of Ramallah, causing many protesters to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. The soldiers also killed a Palestinian child, identified as Maisara Mousa Abu Shallouf, 15, and injured dozens, during the weekly Great Return March processions in the besieged Gaza Strip. Israeli occupation soldiers attacked, Friday, the weekly protest in Kufur Qaddoum town, east of the northern West Bank city of Qalqilia, wounding one Palestinian and causing dozens to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. The Palestinians marched from the center of the village, while chanting for ending the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine, before the soldiers attacked them life rounds, rubber-coated steel bullets, gas bombs and concussion grenades. Medical sources said the soldiers shot a young man with a rubber-coated steel bullet in his leg, and caused dozens of Palestinians to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. The Palestinians hold processions in Kufur Qaddoum every Friday and Saturday, for the eighth consecutive year, demanding the army to reopen the town’s main road, which was blockaded fifteen years ago, to enable easy access for illegal colonialist settlers driving to and from the Kedumim Israeli colony, built on private Palestinian lands. Furthermore, the soldiers injured many Palestinians in Bab az-Zawiya area, in the center of Hebron city, in the southern part of the occupied West Bank. In related news, the soldiers attacked the weekly nonviolent procession against the illegal Annexation Wall and Colonies in Bil’in village, west of the central West Bank city of Ramallah, causing many protesters to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. The soldiers also killed a Palestinian child, identified as Maisara Mousa Abu Shallouf, 15, and injured dozens, during the weekly Great Return March processions in the besieged Gaza Strip. On 54th Friday of Great March of Return and Breaking Siege, Israeli Forces Kill Palestinian Child and Wound 93 Civilians, including 17 Children, 4 Women, 3 Paramedics, and Journalist The Palestinian Center For Human Rights: Ref: 58/2019 Date: 12 April 2019: Time: 18:00 GMT: On Friday evening, 12 April 2019, in excessive use of force against peaceful protesters on the 54th Friday of the March of Return and Breaking the Siege, Israeli forces killed a Palestinian child and wounded 93 civilians, including 17 children, four women, three paramedics, and a journalist, in eastern Gaza Strip. According to observations by PCHR’s fieldworkers, the Israeli forces who stationed in prone positions and in military jeeps along the fence with Israel continued to use excessive force against the demonstrators by opening fire and firing tear gas canisters at them. As a result, dozens of the demonstrators were hit with bullets and teargas canisters without posing any imminent threat or danger to the life of soldiers. On Friday, 14 April 2019, the incidents were as follows: At approximately 16:00, thousands of civilians, including women, children and entire families, started swarming to the five encampments established by the Supreme National Authority of Great March of Return and Breaking the Siege adjacent to the border fence with Israel in eastern Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds, including children and women, approached the border fence with Israel in front of each encampment and gathered tens of meters away from the main border fence, attempting to throw stones at the Israeli forces and firing incendiary balloons along the border fence. Demonstrators chanted slogans, raised flags and, attempted to approach the border fence, set fire to tires and tried to throw stones at the Israeli forces. Although the demonstrators gathered in areas open to the Israeli snipers stationed on the top of the sand berms and military watchtowers and inside and behind the military jeeps, the Israeli forces fired live and rubber bullets in addition to a barrage of tear gas canisters. The Israeli shooting, which continued at around 19:00, resulted in the killing of Maysara Mousa Suliman Abu Shalouf (15), from ‘zbit Beit Hanoun. At approximately 17:00, Maysara sustained a live bullet wound that entered his left waist and settled in the pelvis while standing few meters away from the border fence in eastern Jabalia. He was left bleeding for 20 minutes because medical personnel were unable to access him. After that, he was taken to a medical point and then referred to the Indonesian Hospital, where his death was declared at approximately 17:55. Moreover, 93 civilians, including 17 children, four women, three paramedics, and a journalist, were wounded. Forty-four of them were hit with live bullets and shrapnel, 46 were directly hit with tear gas canisters and three were hit with rubber bullets. In addition, dozens of civilians suffered tear gas inhalation and seizures due to tear gas canisters that were fired by the Israeli forces from the military jeeps and riffles in the eastern Gaza Strip. The following table shows the number of civilian victims due to the Israeli forces’ suppression of the Great March of Return since its beginning on 30 March: Among those wounded, 543 are in serious condition and 136 had their lower or upper limbs amputated; 122 lower-limb amputations, 14 upper-limb amputations, and 25 children had their limbs amputated according to the Ministry of Health. The number of those wounded only include those wounded with live bullets and directly hit with tear gas canisters, as there have been thousand others who suffered tear gas inhalation and sustained bruises. Notes PCHR reiterates Palestinians’ right to peaceful assembly to confront Israel and its forces’ denial of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination, right to return and right to end the occupation of the Palestinian territory. PCHR stresses that the Israeli forces should stop using excessive force and respond to the legitimate demands of the demonstrators, particularly lifting the closure which is the real solution to end the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. PCHR emphasizes that continuously targeting civilians, who exercise their right to peaceful assembly or while carrying out their humanitarian duty, is a serious violation of the rules of international law, international humanitarian law, the ICC Rome Statute and Fourth Geneva Convention. Thus, PCHR reiterates its call upon the ICC Prosecutor to open an official investigation in these crimes and to prosecute and hold accountable all those applying or involved in issuing orders within the Israeli Forces at the security and political echelons. PCHR also emphasizes that the High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention should fulfill their obligation under Article 1; i.e., to respect and ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances and their obligations under Article 146 to prosecute persons alleged to commit grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention. PCHR calls upon Switzerland, in its capacity as the Depository State for the Convention, to demand the High Contracting Parties to convene a meeting and ensure Israel’s respect for this Convention, noting that these grave breaches constitute war crimes under Article 147 of the same Convention and Protocol (I) Additional to the Geneva Conventions regarding the guarantee of Palestinian civilians’ right to protection in the occupied territories.

Two of these orders are about the construction of 2 new settlement roads; one in the northern West Bank and the other in the Southern, while the third order is about closing areas for military purposes. Based on the decisions and the attached road plans clarifying their tracks, the construction of these 2 roads would lead to swallowing up hundreds of dunums of Palestinian agricultural lands as well as the dunums already included in the seizure orders. As part of Israeli settlers’ attacks against Palestinian civilians and their property, PCHR’s fieldworkers during the reporting period 7 incidents carried out by settlers that resulted in the injury of a Palestinian civilian with bruises and another with a stone to the head.

In addition, the PCHR calls upon the international community to speed up the reconstruction process necessary because of the destruction inflicted by the Israeli offensive on Gaza. PCHR calls for a prompt intervention to compel the Israeli authorities to lift the closure that obstructs the freedom of movement of goods and 1.8 million civilians that experience unprecedented economic, social, political and cultural hardships due to collective punishment policies and retaliatory action against civilians.

Comments are in parentheses. Share the link of this article with your facebook friends While brutal force has been used to create Zionist Israel and sustain it thus far, Zionist claims to Palestine are false. Actually, from the five thousand years of known written history, there has been a continuous Palestinian-Canaanite presence in the Holy Land. Despite the Zionist false claims, the ancient Israelites ruled part of the land for only 85 years (during the reign of David, Solomon, and Solomon's son). After that, the Egyptians conquered Palestine-Canaan in 925 BC, followed by Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, before the Arab Muslim rule, starting from 636 AD. By the Time Jesus started his mission, the three population groups of Canaanites, Palestinians, and Israelites were melted together in religion and language. Most of them became Christians when Constantine converted in 313 AD. Then, most of them became Muslims in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. So, Palestinian Muslims, Christians, and Jews are the ones who have the right to claim descent from ancient Israelites, Palestinians, and Canaanites, not Zionists from other continents. The following news stories are just examples of the Israeli occupation government violations of Palestinian human rights, on daily basis. http://imemc.org/, https://paltoday.ps/ar/ More detailed news stories can be found at the following sources: https://english.palinfo.com/ Maisara Abu Shallouf, 15, was killed inside Gaza Strip by Israeli occupation soldiers from across the border, April 12, 2019 Palestinian Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face,   by Israeli occupation soldiers, in Hebron, April 14, 2019 Palestinian school children attacked by tear gas by Israeli occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 14, 2019 Palestinian protesters attacked by tear gas by Israeli   occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 12, 2019 A Palestinian man Saturday was shot in the face by Israeli occupation forces for unknown reasons, north of the city of Hebron in the southern West Bank, according to Maan News. Witnesses said that the victim, Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face, by Israeli police forces. The bullet was reported to have traveled completely through the young man’s face, as seen in the above photo. Medical sources described the injury as moderate, and said Abu Fanous was transferred to a local medical center for treatment. Nowhere is Israel’s use of excessive force against the civilian Palestinian population more clearly exhibited than in the Gaza Strip. Since March 2018, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, 203 Palestinians have been killed, and 12, 056 have been wounded, among those include women, children, medical personnel, and journalists. Israeli occupation soldiers attacked, on Friday evening, the weekly Great March Processions in the besieged Gaza Strip, killing one child, and injuring at 55 others, including one who suffered serious wounds, and two medics. The Palestinian Health Ministry has reported that the soldiers shot a child, identified as Maisara Mousa Ali Abu Shallouf, 15, after shooting him with live fire in the abdomen, east of Jabalia, in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. The soldiers also fired live rounds and gas bombs at medics trying to reach the child to provide him with the urgently needed medical help, before he succumbed to his wounds. Dr. Ashraf al-Qedra, the spokesperson of the Health Ministry In Gaza, said the soldiers shot 66 Palestinians, including 15 children and six women, in addition to two medics. It added that one of the wounded Palestinians suffered life-threatening wounds. The Health Ministry also stated that the soldiers shot two medics and caused others to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. The protests took place in five areas in the eastern parts of the Gaza Strip, from Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia, in the northern part, to Gaza city and central Gaza, in addition to Khan Younis and Rafah, in the southern part of the coastal region. Media sources in Gaza said the army used high-velocity gas bombs, and live fire, targeting many areas far away from the perimeter fence. They added that the soldiers also targeted several ambulances, medics and journalists, with sniper fire, in addition to the high-velocity gas bombs.

As a result, dozens of the demonstrators were hit with bullets and teargas canisters without posing any imminent threat or danger to the life of soldiers. On Friday, 14 April 2019, the incidents were as follows: At approximately 16:00, thousands of civilians, including women, children and entire families, started swarming to the five encampments established by the Supreme National Authority of Great March of Return and Breaking the Siege adjacent to the border fence with Israel in eastern Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds, including children and women, approached the border fence with Israel in front of each encampment and gathered tens of meters away from the main border fence, attempting to throw stones at the Israeli forces and firing incendiary balloons along the border fence. Demonstrators chanted slogans, raised flags and, attempted to approach the border fence, set fire to tires and tried to throw stones at the Israeli forces. Although the demonstrators gathered in areas open to the Israeli snipers stationed on the top of the sand berms and military watchtowers and inside and behind the military jeeps, the Israeli forces fired live and rubber bullets in addition to a barrage of tear gas canisters. The Israeli shooting, which continued at around 19:00, resulted in the killing of Maysara Mousa Suliman Abu Shalouf (15), from ‘zbit Beit Hanoun. At approximately 17:00, Maysara sustained a live bullet wound that entered his left waist and settled in the pelvis while standing few meters away from the border fence in eastern Jabalia.

The number of those wounded only include those wounded with live bullets and directly hit with tear gas canisters, as there have been thousand others who suffered tear gas inhalation and sustained bruises. Notes PCHR reiterates Palestinians’ right to peaceful assembly to confront Israel and its forces’ denial of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination, right to return and right to end the occupation of the Palestinian territory. PCHR stresses that the Israeli forces should stop using excessive force and respond to the legitimate demands of the demonstrators, particularly lifting the closure which is the real solution to end the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. PCHR emphasizes that continuously targeting civilians, who exercise their right to peaceful assembly or while carrying out their humanitarian duty, is a serious violation of the rules of international law, international humanitarian law, the ICC Rome Statute and Fourth Geneva Convention. Thus, PCHR reiterates its call upon the ICC Prosecutor to open an official investigation in these crimes and to prosecute and hold accountable all those applying or involved in issuing orders within the Israeli Forces at the security and political echelons. PCHR also emphasizes that the High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention should fulfill their obligation under Article 1; i.e., to respect and ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances and their obligations under Article 146 to prosecute persons alleged to commit grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention. PCHR calls upon Switzerland, in its capacity as the Depository State for the Convention, to demand the High Contracting Parties to convene a meeting and ensure Israel’s respect for this Convention, noting that these grave breaches constitute war crimes under Article 147 of the same Convention and Protocol (I) Additional to the Geneva Conventions regarding the guarantee of Palestinian civilians’ right to protection in the occupied territories.

[damage] is hit in [Editorial Note: The following news reports are summaries from original sources. They may also include corrections of Arabic names and political terminology. Comments are in parentheses. Share the link of this article with your facebook friends While brutal force has been used to create Zionist Israel and sustain it thus far, Zionist claims to Palestine are false. Actually, from the five thousand years of known written history, there has been a continuous Palestinian-Canaanite presence in the Holy Land. Despite the Zionist false claims, the ancient Israelites ruled part of the land for only 85 years (during the reign of David, Solomon, and Solomon's son). After that, the Egyptians conquered Palestine-Canaan in 925 BC, followed by Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, before the Arab Muslim rule, starting from 636 AD. By the Time Jesus started his mission, the three population groups of Canaanites, Palestinians, and Israelites were melted together in religion and language. Most of them became Christians when Constantine converted in 313 AD. Then, most of them became Muslims in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. So, Palestinian Muslims, Christians, and Jews are the ones who have the right to claim descent from ancient Israelites, Palestinians, and Canaanites, not Zionists from other continents. The following news stories are just examples of the Israeli occupation government violations of Palestinian human rights, on daily basis. http://imemc.org/, https://paltoday.ps/ar/ More detailed news stories can be found at the following sources: https://english.palinfo.com/ Maisara Abu Shallouf, 15, was killed inside Gaza Strip by Israeli occupation soldiers from across the border, April 12, 2019 Palestinian Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face,   by Israeli occupation soldiers, in Hebron, April 14, 2019 Palestinian school children attacked by tear gas by Israeli occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 14, 2019 Palestinian protesters attacked by tear gas by Israeli   occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 12, 2019 A Palestinian man Saturday was shot in the face by Israeli occupation forces for unknown reasons, north of the city of Hebron in the southern West Bank, according to Maan News.

The Palestinians hold processions in Kufur Qaddoum every Friday and Saturday, for the eighth consecutive year, demanding the army to reopen the town’s main road, which was blockaded fifteen years ago, to enable easy access for illegal colonialist settlers driving to and from the Kedumim Israeli colony, built on private Palestinian lands. Furthermore, the soldiers injured many Palestinians in Bab az-Zawiya area, in the center of Hebron city, in the southern part of the occupied West Bank. In related news, the soldiers attacked the weekly nonviolent procession against the illegal Annexation Wall and Colonies in Bil’in village, west of the central West Bank city of Ramallah, causing many protesters to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation.

According to observations by PCHR’s fieldworkers, the Israeli forces who stationed in prone positions and in military jeeps along the fence with Israel continued to use excessive force against the demonstrators by opening fire and firing tear gas canisters at them. As a result, dozens of the demonstrators were hit with bullets and teargas canisters without posing any imminent threat or danger to the life of soldiers. On Friday, 14 April 2019, the incidents were as follows: At approximately 16:00, thousands of civilians, including women, children and entire families, started swarming to the five encampments established by the Supreme National Authority of Great March of Return and Breaking the Siege adjacent to the border fence with Israel in eastern Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds, including children and women, approached the border fence with Israel in front of each encampment and gathered tens of meters away from the main border fence, attempting to throw stones at the Israeli forces and firing incendiary balloons along the border fence. Demonstrators chanted slogans, raised flags and, attempted to approach the border fence, set fire to tires and tried to throw stones at the Israeli forces. Although the demonstrators gathered in areas open to the Israeli snipers stationed on the top of the sand berms and military watchtowers and inside and behind the military jeeps, the Israeli forces fired live and rubber bullets in addition to a barrage of tear gas canisters. The Israeli shooting, which continued at around 19:00, resulted in the killing of Maysara Mousa Suliman Abu Shalouf (15), from ‘zbit Beit Hanoun. At approximately 17:00, Maysara sustained a live bullet wound that entered his left waist and settled in the pelvis while standing few meters away from the border fence in eastern Jabalia. He was left bleeding for 20 minutes because medical personnel were unable to access him. After that, he was taken to a medical point and then referred to the Indonesian Hospital, where his death was declared at approximately 17:55. Moreover, 93 civilians, including 17 children, four women, three paramedics, and a journalist, were wounded. Forty-four of them were hit with live bullets and shrapnel, 46 were directly hit with tear gas canisters and three were hit with rubber bullets. In addition, dozens of civilians suffered tear gas inhalation and seizures due to tear gas canisters that were fired by the Israeli forces from the military jeeps and riffles in the eastern Gaza Strip.

The number of those wounded only include those wounded with live bullets and directly hit with tear gas canisters, as there have been thousand others who suffered tear gas inhalation and sustained bruises. Notes PCHR reiterates Palestinians’ right to peaceful assembly to confront Israel and its forces’ denial of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination, right to return and right to end the occupation of the Palestinian territory. PCHR stresses that the Israeli forces should stop using excessive force and respond to the legitimate demands of the demonstrators, particularly lifting the closure which is the real solution to end the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. PCHR emphasizes that continuously targeting civilians, who exercise their right to peaceful assembly or while carrying out their humanitarian duty, is a serious violation of the rules of international law, international humanitarian law, the ICC Rome Statute and Fourth Geneva Convention. Thus, PCHR reiterates its call upon the ICC Prosecutor to open an official investigation in these crimes and to prosecute and hold accountable all those applying or involved in issuing orders within the Israeli Forces at the security and political echelons. PCHR also emphasizes that the High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention should fulfill their obligation under Article 1; i.e., to respect and ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances and their obligations under Article 146 to prosecute persons alleged to commit grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention. PCHR calls upon Switzerland, in its capacity as the Depository State for the Convention, to demand the High Contracting Parties to convene a meeting and ensure Israel’s respect for this Convention, noting that these grave breaches constitute war crimes under Article 147 of the same Convention and Protocol (I) Additional to the Geneva Conventions regarding the guarantee of Palestinian civilians’ right to protection in the occupied territories.

Waleed added that the Israeli authorities threatened the family to demolish all their houses, which belong to Waleed’s brothers; Khaled and Raed. He stressed that the Israeli authorities clearly target Bir Una’s residents as the Israeli authorities demolished a house belonging to him beside demolishing another one a year ago. Moreover, a month ago, the Israeli authorities demolished a house and barracks belonging to Waleed’s cousins; Mohammed and Moussa Zarina. Waleed indicated that the Israeli policy against the area and the family made them sustain great economic losses.

In addition, the PCHR calls upon the international community to speed up the reconstruction process necessary because of the destruction inflicted by the Israeli offensive on Gaza. PCHR calls for a prompt intervention to compel the Israeli authorities to lift the closure that obstructs the freedom of movement of goods and 1.8 million civilians that experience unprecedented economic, social, political and cultural hardships due to collective punishment policies and retaliatory action against civilians.

[target] is hit in [Editorial Note: The following news reports are summaries from original sources. They may also include corrections of Arabic names and political terminology. Comments are in parentheses. Share the link of this article with your facebook friends While brutal force has been used to create Zionist Israel and sustain it thus far, Zionist claims to Palestine are false. Actually, from the five thousand years of known written history, there has been a continuous Palestinian-Canaanite presence in the Holy Land. Despite the Zionist false claims, the ancient Israelites ruled part of the land for only 85 years (during the reign of David, Solomon, and Solomon's son). After that, the Egyptians conquered Palestine-Canaan in 925 BC, followed by Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, before the Arab Muslim rule, starting from 636 AD. By the Time Jesus started his mission, the three population groups of Canaanites, Palestinians, and Israelites were melted together in religion and language. Most of them became Christians when Constantine converted in 313 AD. Then, most of them became Muslims in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. So, Palestinian Muslims, Christians, and Jews are the ones who have the right to claim descent from ancient Israelites, Palestinians, and Canaanites, not Zionists from other continents. The following news stories are just examples of the Israeli occupation government violations of Palestinian human rights, on daily basis. http://imemc.org/, https://paltoday.ps/ar/ More detailed news stories can be found at the following sources: https://english.palinfo.com/ Maisara Abu Shallouf, 15, was killed inside Gaza Strip by Israeli occupation soldiers from across the border, April 12, 2019 Palestinian Hussain Abed Abu Fanous, was shot with live fire in the face,   by Israeli occupation soldiers, in Hebron, April 14, 2019 Palestinian school children attacked by tear gas by Israeli occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 14, 2019 Palestinian protesters attacked by tear gas by Israeli   occupation soldiers in Al-Khalil (Hebron), April 12, 2019 A Palestinian man Saturday was shot in the face by Israeli occupation forces for unknown reasons, north of the city of Hebron in the southern West Bank, according to Maan News.

The bullet was reported to have traveled completely through the young man’s face, as seen in the above photo. Medical sources described the injury as moderate, and said Abu Fanous was transferred to a local medical center for treatment. Nowhere is Israel’s use of excessive force against the civilian Palestinian population more clearly exhibited than in the Gaza Strip. Since March 2018, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, 203 Palestinians have been killed, and 12, 056 have been wounded, among those include women, children, medical personnel, and journalists. Israeli occupation soldiers attacked, on Friday evening, the weekly Great March Processions in the besieged Gaza Strip, killing one child, and injuring at 55 others, including one who suffered serious wounds, and two medics. The Palestinian Health Ministry has reported that the soldiers shot a child, identified as Maisara Mousa Ali Abu Shallouf, 15, after shooting him with live fire in the abdomen, east of Jabalia, in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. The soldiers also fired live rounds and gas bombs at medics trying to reach the child to provide him with the urgently needed medical help, before he succumbed to his wounds. Dr. Ashraf al-Qedra, the spokesperson of the Health Ministry In Gaza, said the soldiers shot 66 Palestinians, including 15 children and six women, in addition to two medics. It added that one of the wounded Palestinians suffered life-threatening wounds.

The protests took place in five areas in the eastern parts of the Gaza Strip, from Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia, in the northern part, to Gaza city and central Gaza, in addition to Khan Younis and Rafah, in the southern part of the coastal region. Media sources in Gaza said the army used high-velocity gas bombs, and live fire, targeting many areas far away from the perimeter fence. They added that the soldiers also targeted several ambulances, medics and journalists, with sniper fire, in addition to the high-velocity gas bombs. The protests this week were also in support and solidarity with the Israeli occupation soldiers fired, Sunday, dozens of gas bombs into several schools, and surrounding areas in Hebron city, in the southern part of the occupied West Bank, causing dozens of schoolchildren and teachers, to suffer the effects of teargas inhalation. Media sources said dozens of soldiers invaded the southern area of Hebron city, and fired a barrage of gas bombs into several schools, and their surrounding areas. Dozens of schoolchildren, and several teachers, suffered the effects of teargas inhalation and received the needed medical treatment. The Israeli army claimed several Palestinians hurled stones at the military vehicles, however, the schools and many homes in southern Hebron, especially around the Ibrahimi Mosque, are subject to constant violations not only by the soldiers, but also by the illegal Israeli colonists who frequently attack the residents, especially the students while heading to school or returning to their homes, in addition to the Palestinian homes and property. In related news, the soldiers abducted Sari and Yousef al-Akel, from Beit Ola town, while walking in Tal Romedia neighborhood in the center of Hebron city.

Medics rushed to the school and provided the wounded students with the urgently needed medical attention, and moved many of them to a local medical center for further treatment. It is worth mentioning that the school has been a target of frequent attacks and violations by Israeli soldiers and illegal colonialist settlers and was shut down six times this current semester. The latest assault was carried out after illegal Israeli colonists from Yitzhar colony, which was built on Palestinian lands, attacked the village and several surrounding village, and damaged to cars in addition to causing fractures to one Palestinian. Israeli occupation soldiers abducted, on Sunday at dawn, at least fifteen Palestinians, including the governor of occupied East Jerusalem, after storming their homes and ransacking them, in several parts of the West Bank. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Society (PPS) has reported that the soldiers abducted Jerusalem governor, Adnan Gheith, who was previously repeatedly abducted, interrogated and imprisoned, in addition to four Palestinians, identified as Mohammad Samir Obeid, Bashar Mheisin, Tajuddin Maher Mheisin and Mohammad Omran Obeid. It is worth mentioning that, after abducting the governor several times since October of 2018, the Israeli army issued orders barring him from entering the West Bank for six months. In Tulkarem, in northern West Bank, the soldiers invaded and searched homes in Far’un town, south of the city, and abducted Islam Jihad ‘Adwan, Ezzeddin Mohammad Hamed, Wasim Samir Farkh, Shadi Tal’at Toheimer and Hamoud Mohammad Hamed. In Hebron, in southern West Bank, the soldiers also invaded and searched homes and abducted four Palestinians, identified as Amin Khalil as-Sous and Hayel Ishaq Rajoub, from Doura town, south of Hebron, in addition to Zeineddin Nafeth Jaradat and Hamada Hasan Jaradat, both fifteen years of age, from Sa’ir town, east of the city.

The Israeli army also regularly detains and opens fire on unarmed Palestinian fishermen, shepherds, and farmers along the border areas, if they approach the buffer zone, as authorities have not made clear the precise area of the designated zone. The practice has in effect destroyed much of the agricultural and fishing sector of the blockaded coastal enclave, which has been under an Israeli air, land, and sea blockade for 10 years.

On 54th Friday of Great March of Return and Breaking Siege, Israeli Forces Kill Palestinian Child and Wound 93 Civilians, including 17 Children, 4 Women, 3 Paramedics, and Journalist The Palestinian Center For Human Rights: Ref: 58/2019 Date: 12 April 2019: Time: 18:00 GMT: On Friday evening, 12 April 2019, in excessive use of force against peaceful protesters on the 54th Friday of the March of Return and Breaking the Siege, Israeli forces killed a Palestinian child and wounded 93 civilians, including 17 children, four women, three paramedics, and a journalist, in eastern Gaza Strip. According to observations by PCHR’s fieldworkers, the Israeli forces who stationed in prone positions and in military jeeps along the fence with Israel continued to use excessive force against the demonstrators by opening fire and firing tear gas canisters at them. As a result, dozens of the demonstrators were hit with bullets and teargas canisters without posing any imminent threat or danger to the life of soldiers. On Friday, 14 April 2019, the incidents were as follows: At approximately 16:00, thousands of civilians, including women, children and entire families, started swarming to the five encampments established by the Supreme National Authority of Great March of Return and Breaking the Siege adjacent to the border fence with Israel in eastern Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds, including children and women, approached the border fence with Israel in front of each encampment and gathered tens of meters away from the main border fence, attempting to throw stones at the Israeli forces and firing incendiary balloons along the border fence. Demonstrators chanted slogans, raised flags and, attempted to approach the border fence, set fire to tires and tried to throw stones at the Israeli forces. Although the demonstrators gathered in areas open to the Israeli snipers stationed on the top of the sand berms and military watchtowers and inside and behind the military jeeps, the Israeli forces fired live and rubber bullets in addition to a barrage of tear gas canisters. The Israeli shooting, which continued at around 19:00, resulted in the killing of Maysara Mousa Suliman Abu Shalouf (15), from ‘zbit Beit Hanoun. At approximately 17:00, Maysara sustained a live bullet wound that entered his left waist and settled in the pelvis while standing few meters away from the border fence in eastern Jabalia.

The number of those wounded only include those wounded with live bullets and directly hit with tear gas canisters, as there have been thousand others who suffered tear gas inhalation and sustained bruises. Notes PCHR reiterates Palestinians’ right to peaceful assembly to confront Israel and its forces’ denial of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination, right to return and right to end the occupation of the Palestinian territory. PCHR stresses that the Israeli forces should stop using excessive force and respond to the legitimate demands of the demonstrators, particularly lifting the closure which is the real solution to end the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. PCHR emphasizes that continuously targeting civilians, who exercise their right to peaceful assembly or while carrying out their humanitarian duty, is a serious violation of the rules of international law, international humanitarian law, the ICC Rome Statute and Fourth Geneva Convention. Thus, PCHR reiterates its call upon the ICC Prosecutor to open an official investigation in these crimes and to prosecute and hold accountable all those applying or involved in issuing orders within the Israeli Forces at the security and political echelons. PCHR also emphasizes that the High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention should fulfill their obligation under Article 1; i.e., to respect and ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances and their obligations under Article 146 to prosecute persons alleged to commit grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention. PCHR calls upon Switzerland, in its capacity as the Depository State for the Convention, to demand the High Contracting Parties to convene a meeting and ensure Israel’s respect for this Convention, noting that these grave breaches constitute war crimes under Article 147 of the same Convention and Protocol (I) Additional to the Geneva Conventions regarding the guarantee of Palestinian civilians’ right to protection in the occupied territories.
